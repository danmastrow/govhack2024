# govhack2024


## Notes
- Utilizes ChatGPT, with a System prompt of a formatted markdown of the grammar/punctuation/words subsection
- Can be kept up to date by rerunning the dataset.
- Explored RAG's with entire dataset and ElasticSearch, found the results not desirable
- Decided to focus on specific spelling, grammar and punctuation section.
- Future could be:
    - Created into a Chrome/Browser Extension, to avoid having to use a seperate website
    - Implemented into GovCMS so that when content is being submitted its also reviewed
