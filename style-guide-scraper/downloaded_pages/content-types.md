Content types
=============

Use the format that helps meet the user’s need. This could be a form, a blog, an image or another format.

*   [Blogs](/content-types/blogs)
    -----------------------------
    
    Blog posts can help users solve common problems. Use clear structures and ensure content is accessible. Moderate comments if you allow them.
    
*   [Easy Read](/content-types/easy-read)
    -------------------------------------
    
    Easy Read combines text with layout and imagery to simplify and explain information. Users often print Easy Read materials. The standard layout works as a handout.
    
*   [Emails and letters](/content-types/emails-and-letters)
    -------------------------------------------------------
    
    Concise letters and emails tell a recipient what they need to know. Use the right level of formality for the recipient and purpose. Be mindful of people’s privacy.
    
*   [Forms](/content-types/forms)
    -----------------------------
    
    This guidance helps you to design digital forms filled in by the user. Most of the guidance also applies to printed forms, but there are some differences noted.
    
*   [Images](/content-types/images)
    -------------------------------
    
    Images can help users if they are clear and simple. Make sure everyone can access the information that images convey.
    
    *   [Alt text, captions and titles for images](/content-types/images/alt-text-captions-and-titles-images)
    
*   [Journals, magazines and newspapers](/content-types/journals-magazines-and-newspapers)
    --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    
    Journals, magazines and newspapers are known as ‘periodicals’. Periodicals are published at regular intervals, so they are sometimes called ‘serials’. Number each issue of a serial and include other publication information so people can find it.
    
*   [PDF (Portable Document Format)](/content-types/pdf-portable-document-format)
    -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
    
    Only create PDFs if your research shows there are specific needs for this format. Make PDF content accessible to everyone who needs it.
    
*   [Reports](/content-types/reports)
    ---------------------------------
    
    Create complete reports with a landing page, preliminary content, body and endmatter. Include other parts if the report needs to be tabled in parliament.
    
*   [Social media](/content-types/social-media)
    -------------------------------------------
    
    Social media can enhance your engagement with users and stakeholders. Identify the audience, purpose and platforms and design content for them.
    
*   [Video and audio](/content-types/video-and-audio)
    -------------------------------------------------
    
    Video and audio are time-based media. Users can choose when and how much they view or listen to. If the format meets a user need, make sure anyone can access the content.
