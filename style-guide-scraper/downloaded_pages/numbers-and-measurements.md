    ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    
    Dates and expressions of time need to be readable and clear, particularly in content that contains detailed timelines. Write, abbreviate and punctuate dates and times consistently so people can understand your content. Follow international and Australian standards to write dates and times for data systems and international communication.

    ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    
    A mathematical relationship is the connection between sets of numbers or variables. In most content, the connection should be described in words. Only use symbols if there’s a user need. Code symbols correctly to ensure they are accessible.

    Ordinal numbers, such as ‘first’, ‘second’ and ‘third’, show the order, position or importance of things in a list or sequence.
    
*   [Percentages](/grammar-punctuation-and-conventions/numbers-and-measurements/percentages)

    Percentages help people compare things and understand proportions. Use numerals with the percentage sign. Be concise when you write about percentages.
