===========================

Use shortened forms if they help the user understand quicker. Make sure everyone understands them.

    ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    
    Acronyms and initialisms are shortened forms. They replace full names and special terms in text. Use them only if people recognise and understand them.
    
*   [Contractions](/grammar-punctuation-and-conventions/shortened-words-and-phrases/contractions)
    ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    
    Contractions are shortened words. People will read and understand them depending on their context. Avoid them in formal content.

    Use English rather than Latin shortened forms, except in some cases. People will prefer the English equivalent unless the context requires special use.
