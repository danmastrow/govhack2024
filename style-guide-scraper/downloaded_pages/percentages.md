Percentages
===========

Percentages help people compare things and understand proportions. Use numerals with the percentage sign. Be concise when you write about percentages.  

Use numerals with the percentage sign
-------------------------------------

Use the percentage sign next to a numeral in text. Don’t use a space between the number and the percentage sign.

### Incorrect

Use decimals rather than fractions with the percentage sign.

As for any number, avoid starting a sentence with the percentage. Reword the sentence if possible, or write the percentage out in words. You can use everyday words if a precise amount is not needed.

Avoid using percentages to describe changes.

Tell people what the actual increase or decrease is.
