Classics
========

Classics are works from ancient and medieval times. Cite titles in line with the author–date system. Use correct attribution to help people find the source in its original language or as an English translation.  

Cite classics as book titles
----------------------------

Disciplines and sources define the term ‘classics’ in different ways. This guidance covers ancient Greek and Roman works (until the 5th century) and works from the medieval period (from the fall of the Roman empire until the middle of the 15th century).

In references and in-text citations, treat the titles of classics as you would other book titles.

*   Use sentence case – capitalise only the first letter of the title and the first letter of any proper noun.
*   Use italics for the titles of books, series and anthologies.
*   Use quotation marks for the titles of chapters, poems or sections.

If you’re using a reference list, include any classics that you cite.

Examples of in-text citations and reference lists on this page follow the author–date system, as this is the most common way of citing the classics in government content. If your organisation uses the documentary–note system, change the citation and style of reference list accordingly.

Use correct in-text citations
-----------------------------

Often there will not be much information for classics. For example, you might not know the date of publication.

Include the information that you know in in-text citations.

If you don’t know the name of the author, don’t use ‘Anon’_,_ ‘unknown’ or ‘Anonymous’ in the in-text citation.

### Like this

*   _Beowulf_ is the story of a hero who defeats a dragon.
*   Like Grendel (_Beowulf_), you seem to suffer with the joy of others.

### Not this

*   _Beowulf_ (Anon) is the story of a hero who defeats a dragon.
*   Like Grendel (Anonymous _Beowulf_), you seem to suffer with the joy of others.

If you don’t know the author or the date of a work, use the name of the translator (trans) and the date of publication of the edition you’re working with. Place the date at the end of the reference.

### Example

_Beowulf_ (Heaney S, trans), Faber & Faber Ltd, London, 2002. \[Reference-list entry\]

Use common names for authors
----------------------------

Most authors of the classical and medieval periods are known just by a common name, rather than a given name and a surname.

Use the author’s common name in text, in-text citations and reference lists.

As with other books, if you mention the author in the sentence, don’t place the author’s name in brackets with the title of the work.

### Write this

As Cicero expressed it, ‘Is there anything rasher and more unworthy of the dignity and strength of character of a wise man than the holding of a false opinion?’ (_On the nature of the gods_)

### Not this

As Marcus Tullius Cicero expressed it, ‘Is there anything rasher and more unworthy of the dignity and strength of character of a wise man than the holding of a false opinion?’ (_On the nature of the gods_)

Include divisions in in-text citations when possible
----------------------------------------------------

Some classics have divisions. Divisions organise prose and poetry into, for example, books, chapters, sections, lines and verses.

### Example

*   As one of the early philosophers wrote, ‘All wars are undertaken for the acquisition of wealth.’ (Plato _Phaedo_ 65C–66E)
*   He ended his retirement speech with Ovid’s ‘Turn loose the swans that drew my poet’s car.’ (_The art of love_ 3.810)
*   Josh hesitated at the doorway until, like Dante, he ‘went on, timid and full of thought’. (Dante _The divine comedy_ 20.151) \[In this example, Dante appears in the text as a character in _The divine comedy_ and appears in the citation as author\]

In the examples above:

*   ‘65C–66E’ are section numbers
*   ‘3.810’ means book 3, line 810
*   ‘20.151’ means canto 20, line 151.

If the work you’re citing has divisions, quote them in the in-text citation. The first time you cite a work, spell out the divisions. Place a comma between the title of the work and the first division. Separate divisions with a comma.

### Example

*   (Ovid _The art of love_, book 3, line 810)
*   Josh hesitated at the doorway until, like Dante, he ‘went on, timid and full of thought.’ (Dante _The divine comedy_, canto 20, line 151)

For subsequent citations, don’t spell out the divisions. You only need the division numbers. Separate divisions with a full stop. Don’t place a comma between the title of the work and the division numbers.

### Example

*   (Ovid _The art of love_ 3.815)
*   (Dante _The divine comedy_ 20.151)

If you have only one division to cite, always spell it out. Place a comma between the title and the division.

### Example

Virgil and Dante argue over the value of pitying the sinners in their suffering. (Dante _The divine comedy_, canto 20)

If you’re referring to an edition that doesn’t have divisions, you can refer to specific page numbers. In these cases, place the date of the translation – or edition – you’re working with and the page number after the title of the work. Separate the date from the page numbers with a colon, not a full stop. Don’t use spaces around the colon.

### Example

*   As one of the early philosophers wrote, ‘All wars are undertaken for the acquisition of wealth.’ (Plato _Phaedo_ 1954:85)
*   Josh hesitated at the doorway until, like Dante, he ‘went on, timid and full of thought.’ (_The divine comedy_ 1954:265)

Cite titles in the most appropriate language
--------------------------------------------

Most of the time, you’ll be working with translations. The exception is when you’re quoting text in the original language.

**Accessibility requirements**

If any text should be pronounced in its original language (rather than English), screen readers need to be able to determine what that language is.

WCAG quick reference: [3.1.2 Language of parts – level AA](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/quickref/?showtechniques=312%2C131#language-of-parts)

### Translated works

In in-text citations, refer to the English title that appears on the source you’re citing. If you include the work in a reference list, use the date of the translation and the name of the translator (‘trans’).

#### Example

*   The heroism of women is a common motif in the stories of Hecuba, Andromache and Cassandra. (Euripides _The Trojan women_) \[In-text citation\]
*   Euripides, [_The Trojan women_](https://www.gutenberg.org/files/35171/35171-h/35171-h.htm), (Murray G and Allen G, trans), London, 1905; Project Gutenberg, 2011, accessed 30 November 2019. \[Reference-list entry: the date of the translation was 1905.\]

### Works in the original language

You will rarely need to cite works in the original language.

In these cases, cite the title in the original language. If the original language uses a different alphabet to English – ancient Greek for example – use the anglicised spelling.

#### Like this

_Troiades_ \[The ancient Greek name for _The Trojan women_, a play by Euripides\]

#### Not this

_Τρῳάδες_ \[The Greek spelling of _Troiades_\]

List classics with other references
-----------------------------------

You don’t usually need a reference list for classics.

If you are using a reference list because you’re citing other works as well, then include the classics you have cited.

If you include a classics work in the reference list, cite the particular translation and edition you are working with. Make sure you:

*   specify the date of the edition, not the date of the creation of the work
*   acknowledge the translator (‘trans’)
*   place the date at the end of the reference list entry – this is contrary to author–date style, but it stops possible confusion caused by, for example, ‘Plato (1954)’
*   hyperlink titles in digital content where available.

### Example

*   Plato, _Phaedo_ (Tredennick H, trans), Penguin, Harmondsworth, 1954.
*   Dante, _The divine comedy_ (Ruse HR, trans), Holt, Rinehart and Winston, New York, 1954.

Release notes

The digital edition expands and updates information in the sixth edition about citing the classics. For example, it recommends using the division number as well as the author’s name for in-text references.

The Content Guide did not mention classics.
