Training and professional development
=====================================

The Style Manual team does not run training. Australian Public Service employees can access training through the Australian Public Service Academy (APS Academy). People working in Australian, state or local government can join the Digital Profession to connect with others.

APS Academy training
--------------------

The [APS Academy](https://www.apsacademy.gov.au/) provides training in writing and editing for Australian Public Service employees. This training is based on the content in the Style Manual.

The APS Academy is responsible for developing [APS Craft](https://www.apsacademy.gov.au/aps-craft) – the essential skills that public servants need in order to deliver good policy and services.

Writing is one of the fundamental skills required of APS employees. The APS Academy offers writing skills workshops for those seeking to:

*   be more effective at their current level
*   transition to a new role or level.

[_Essential writing for APS 1–4 levels_](https://www.apsacademy.gov.au/essential-writing-aps-1-4-levels) highlights the relationship between plain language and accessibility and readability. It also covers active voice, punctuation and types of lists.

[_Essential writing for APS 5–6 levels_](https://www.apsacademy.gov.au/essential-writing-aps-5-6-levels) suits all APS and executive level staff who write analytically. It focuses on how to outline an evidence‑based argument and recommend a course of action.

[_Essential writing for executive levels_](https://www.apsacademy.gov.au/essential-writing-executive-levels) is suitable for staff who:

*   manage or coordinate writing tasks with others’ input
*   transfer into a role demanding higher-level writing skills.

The APS Academy also provides training in:

*   [editing and proofreading](https://www.apsacademy.gov.au/editing-and-proofreading)
*   [grammar and punctuation](https://www.apsacademy.gov.au/grammar-and-punctuation)
*   [report writing](https://www.apsacademy.gov.au/report-writing-aps).

Digital Profession
------------------
