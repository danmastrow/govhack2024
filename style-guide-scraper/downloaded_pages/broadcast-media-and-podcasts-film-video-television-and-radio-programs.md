Broadcast media and podcasts (film, video, television and radio programs)
=========================================================================

Cite film, television, radio and podcast programs so people can find the source material. Use the right style and comply with copyright laws.  

Cite electronic media correctly
-------------------------------

Electronic media include film, television, radio and podcasts. When you write about electronic media you could also be referring to a script or a review.

Many of the general naming rules apply:

*   Use sentence case – retain initial capitals for the first word, proper nouns and proper adjectives.
*   Use italics for published works and roman type for unpublished works.
*   Use roman type and quotation marks for parts of works, such as episodes.
*   Use roman type and the spelling and capitalisation that the company uses for the names of channels, streaming services and networks.
*   Use full names of organisations the first time you mention them.

Italicise the titles of films, television and radio programs, and podcasts.

Place the names of episodes in quotation marks and roman type.

Examples of in-text citations and reference lists on this page follow the author–date system, as this is the most common way of citing film, television and radio programs in government content.

### Copyright requirements

You must attribute copyright material you reference. This includes video and audio.

Include all the details required by open access licences (read how to [attribute Creative Commons](https://creativecommons.org.au/learn/fact-sheets/attribution/)).

Read the government copyright rules in the [_Australian Government intellectual property manual_](https://www.infrastructure.gov.au/media-centre/publications/australian-government-intellectual-property-manual).

Use italics and sentence case for film titles
---------------------------------------------

Write the title as it appears in film information. Include punctuation marks and any intentional misspelling. Italicise the title and use sentence case.

If the film is part of a series, include the number of the series in the same format as in the original title of the film. For example, if the original title has the number written as a word, use the word.

In-text citations of films often include the year of production. Place this after the title in roman type and enclosed in parentheses.

If you mention the date in the text, you don’t have to include it in parentheses.

### Example

*   _Ride like a girl_ (2019) tells the story of jockey Michelle Payne.
*   _Picnic at Hanging Rock_ (1975) helped to revive the Australian film industry in the 1970s.
*   _Mad Max 2_ (1981) was the second in the Mad Max series of films.
*   They released _The man from Snowy River II_ in 1988.

After the first mention, you can abbreviate the title as long as it makes sense. You can also omit the date in parentheses. This often happens with well-known and longer titles because it improves the flow of the text.

### Example

_Picnic at Hanging Rock_ (1975) continues to be a popular film. Joan Lindsay wrote the story that formed the basis for _Picnic._

### Reference list entries for films

In a reference list, use the director and the year of release. Include the place of production if known. If there is no credited director, use the name of the producer.

Rule: Director D (director) or Producer P (producer) (Year) _Title of film: subtitle of film_ \[motion picture\], Name of Studio or Publisher, Place of Production.

#### Example

Seet S (director) (2019) _Storm boy_ \[motion picture\], Ambience Entertainment, Screen Australia, South Australian Film Corporation, Australia.

Safran H (director) (1976) _Storm boy_ \[motion picture\], South Australian Film Corporation, Australia.

Jury WF (producer) (1916) _Battle of the Somme_ \[motion picture\], British Topical Committee for War Films, London, UK.

Italicise television programs
-----------------------------

Use sentence case, roman type and quotation marks for episodes of a program.

Use roman type and no quotation marks for the names of:

*   production companies
*   networks
*   channels
*   streaming services.

Include the year of production of television programs in roman type and brackets.

### Example

*   _Gruen_ is a popular television program on ABC TV.
*   The _Australian story_ episode ‘Out of the blue’ is about a shark attack in the Whitsundays.
*   Channel 7 has been screening cricket over the summer.
*   One of the longest-running police dramas on Australian television was _Homicide_ (1964–77).

Use arabic – not roman – numerals for the numbers of seasons.

### Like this

### Not this

Season II of _Offspring_ introduced the character of Dr Patrick Reid.

### Reference list entries for television programs

Rule: Director D (director) or Producer P (producer) (Year) ‘Title of episode: subtitle of episode’ \[television program\], _Name of series_ (season number, episode number), Name of Station or Studio, Place of Production.

### Example

If the episode doesn’t have a name, write the name of the program first.

### Example
