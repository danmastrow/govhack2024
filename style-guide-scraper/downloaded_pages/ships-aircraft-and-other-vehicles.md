Ships, aircraft and other vehicles
==================================

Names of ships, aircraft and other vehicles follow a set style. Using the correct style helps people identify the names of vehicles in text.  

Italicise specific names and use capitals
-----------------------------------------

Write the names of individual ships, aircraft and other vehicles:

*   in italics
*   with initial capitals.

This makes the name of the ship, aircraft or other vehicle clear. The name contrasts with the rest of the sentence.

Don't use the definite article for navy ships.

### Example

*   HMAS _Canberra_ is the Royal Australian Navy’s flagship.
*   Australian–American astronaut Andy Thomas flew his first flight in space aboard the _Endeavour_.
*   The _Indian Pacific_ travels 4,532 kilometres from Perth to Sydney.

### Accessibility requirements

Screen readers don’t pronounce italics. Use the semantic tag <em> to provide emphasis for italicised names in HTML.

### Names in citations

Separate the names of vehicles from titles in [citations and reference lists](/node/181). Separate them according to the type of publication:

*   If the title is in italics (such as in book and website titles), use roman type for the name of the vehicle.
*   If the title is in roman type (such as a journal article), use italics for the name of the vehicle.

#### Example

*   Mair C (2013) _The lucky ship: the nine lives of the Australian coaster_ Tambar _1912–1960_, Nautical Association of Australia, Australia.
*   McMaugh D (21 March 2020) ‘_Albatross_ breaks bread with women in need of a hand’, _Navy Daily_, accessed 24 March 2020.

Don’t write brands or types of vehicles in italics
--------------------------------------------------

Begin the names of the brands, models and classes of vehicles with an initial capital letter but don’t use italics.

### Example

*   She was driving a Toyota Corolla.
*   A Boeing 737 brought the Australians home.
*   They travelled in a Commodore for the last part of the journey.

Don’t italicise or capitalise types of ships, aircraft or other vehicles. Use an initial capital for a generic name only if it starts a sentence.

### Example

*   During the Second World War, flying boats were deployed to strike remote enemy targets to Australia’s north.
*   The Waco 10 was an open-cockpit biplane introduced in 1927.
*   Mail trains stop at every town, adding hours to the trip.

Don’t italicise the definite article (the word ‘the’) before the vehicle’s name unless it is part of the name.

### Example

*   _The_ _Ghan_ takes 54 hours to travel from Adelaide to Darwin. \[The definite article is part of the train’s name.\]
*   The _Dreamtime_ was on the shortlist for the name of Qantas’s new fleet of Boeing 787 Dreamliners. \[The definite article is not part of the ship's name.\]

Don’t put the abbreviated parts of a ship’s name in italics.

### Example

*   HMAS _Arunta_, HMAS _Sydney_
*   The PS _Albury_ travelled the Murray River in the mid-1800s.

Don’t use italics for the ship’s class name. 

### Example

HMAS _Anzac_ _(III)_ is the lead ship of eight Anzac Class frigates.

Refer to vehicles with the pronoun ‘it’
---------------------------------------

Use the pronoun ‘it’ for ships, aircraft and other vehicles. Do not write ‘she’ when referring to vehicles in government content. Use pronouns that reflect [gender-neutral language](/node/64#use_genderneutral_language).

### Example

Brisbane was the first stop for the replica _Endeavour_ on its maiden circumnavigation of Australia.
