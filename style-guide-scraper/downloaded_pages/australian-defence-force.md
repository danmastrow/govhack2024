Australian Defence Force
========================

Use the correct title and style to refer to members of the armed services. This guidance is intended primarily for users outside the Department of Defence and the Australian Defence Force.  

Use terminology correctly
-------------------------

Use the term ‘Defence’ when you mean both the Department of Defence and the Australian Defence Force (ADF). ‘Defence’ is used to represent the organisation as a whole.

‘Defence’ has an initial capital when it is part of a [formal name or title](https://www.stylemanual.gov.au/grammar-punctuation-and-conventions/types-words/nouns#proper_nouns_are_the_names_of_people_and_specific_things). Use lower case for generic references.

Use ‘Australian Defence Force’ and ‘ADF’ when referring to the Royal Australian Navy, Australian Army and Royal Australian Air Force, commanded by the [Chief of the Defence Force](https://www.defence.gov.au/about/leaders/chief-defence-force).

Use ‘Department of Defence’ when referring to the department, headed by the [Secretary of the Department of Defence](https://www.defence.gov.au/about/leaders/secretary).

### Example

*   Defence engages with industry to deliver procurement outcomes that support departmental and ADF capability.
*   The institute’s paper examines the implications for our defence strategy over the next decade.
*   The aim is to support Australian Defence Force personnel and their families as they transition from military to civilian life.
*   The Department of Defence operates under the _Public Service Act 1999_.

Follow the order of precedence for the 3 arms of the ADF
--------------------------------------------------------

There are 3 arms of the ADF, known collectively as the ‘services’ (‘Services’ inside Defence). When referring to the services, follow the order of precedence established by the [_Defence Act 1903_](https://www.legislation.gov.au/Details/C2021C00371):

*   Royal Australian Navy
*   Australian Army
*   Royal Australian Air Force.

Always use initial capitals when writing the short names of the services:

*   Navy
*   Army
*   Air Force.

### Example

*   Defence Reserves are an essential part of the Navy, Army and Air Force

Address members of the ADF by rank, name and post-nominals
----------------------------------------------------------

Use the following order to address members of the ADF:

*   rank
*   given name or initials
*   family name
*   post-nominals
*   service (for commissioned officers in the Navy only).

Do this:

*   the first time you write their name in body text
*   in address blocks in correspondence
*   when introducing an ADF member as speaker
*   in official records of proceedings
*   in lists in organisational publications such as annual reports.

ADF ranks are listed in the table ‘[Ranks and salutations](#ranks)’.

### Example

*   Rear Admiral Robert W Plath AM RAN
*   Lieutenant General Susan Coyle AM CSC DSM
*   Air Marshal Mel Hupfeld AO DSC
*   \[Don’t use commas\]

If you mention the name again in body text, use rank and family name.

### Example

*   Chief Petty Officer Ray Rosendale CSM is a Kuku Yalanji man of the Western Sunset Clan. He was born in Nambour and joined the Navy in 1991. Chief Petty Officer Rosendale now has a role advising the Navy on First Nations cultural affairs.

### Only one rank has a hyphen

Write military ranks of more than one word as separate words. Do not hyphenate the rank.

There is one exception from the Air Force: Air Vice-Marshal. It is always hyphenated.

### Example

*   Acting Sub Lieutenant DW Midson RAN
*   Warrant Officer Class One K Felmingham NSC OAM
*   Air Vice-Marshal Catherine Roberts AM CSC

### Post-nominals

Post-nominals are letters after a name that stand for academic, civil and military [awards and honours](https://www.stylemanual.gov.au/style-rules-and-conventions/titles-honours-forms-address/awards-and-honours).

Write post-nominals after the family name. Place post-nominals before the shortened form showing service (‘RAN’).

Make sure you write post-nominals in the [right order](https://www.stylemanual.gov.au/style-rules-and-conventions/titles-honours-forms-address/awards-and-honours#use_postnominals_in_the_correct_order).

Don’t use commas before or between post-nominals.

#### Example

*   Commander Algirdus Diciunas MBE CSM RAN
*   Lieutenant General Natasha Fox AO CSC
*   Air Commodore Michael Kitcher AM DSC

### Use ‘RAN’ to indicate Navy service for commissioned officers

Use ‘RAN’ (Royal Australian Navy) for all commissioned officers of the Navy. Place ‘RAN’ after the family name and any post-nominals.

Don’t use an acronym to show service for officers in the Army or Air Force.

In Defence, ‘RAN’ is used to distinguish naval officers from officers in the other services and from naval officers in other countries.

Gazettal notices of Australian awards and honours follow this style. For consistency, the Style Manual recommends that Australian Government organisations also follow this practice.

#### Example

*   Captain Catherine Wilsen AO \[Army\]
*   Captain Stephen Beckmann AO CSC RAN \[Navy\]

### Write the rank before the title of ADF members who are knighted

When someone has a military rank and another title such as ‘Sir’, ‘Dame’ or ‘the Honourable’, place the military rank first.

#### Example

*   General Sir John Monash GCMG KBE VD

Address chaplains and maritime spiritual wellbeing officers by title
--------------------------------------------------------------------

Army and Air Force chaplains wear military rank.

Navy chaplains and maritime spiritual wellbeing officers (MSWOs) do not wear military rank. Instead, they wear chaplaincy or MWSO insignia and a service badge with the symbol of their faith or purpose. This gives them ‘floating rank’, meaning they take on the rank of the person they are talking to.

Address chaplains with their chaplaincy title, not a military rank.

MSWOs have been part of the Navy since 2020. Address them with their MSWO title, not a military rank.

Include any post-nominals.

The chaplaincy titles are:

*   Principal Chaplain (Navy and Army) and Principal Air Chaplain (Air Force)
*   Senior Chaplain (Navy) and Chaplain (Navy, Army and Air Force).

The MSWO titles include:

*   Principal Maritime Spiritual Wellbeing Officer
*   Senior Maritime Spiritual Wellbeing Officer
*   Maritime Spiritual Wellbeing Officer.

### Example

*   Principal Chaplain Darren Jaensch \[Army\]
*   Principal Air Chaplain Kevin Russell CSC GAICD \[Air Force\]
*   Senior Chaplain Brian Rayner OAM RAN \[Navy\]
*   Chaplain Catherine Inches-Ogden CSC \[Army\]
*   Maritime Spiritual Wellbeing Officer Tammy Dunne \[Navy\]

Address retired officers of the ADF by rank
-------------------------------------------

Commissioned officers who retire can continue to use their military rank. When writing their name, use their rank and include ‘(Retd)’ after any post-nominals.

### Example

*   General the Honourable Sir Peter Cosgrove AK CVO MC (Retd)

Avoid using the shortened forms of ranks
----------------------------------------

For internal Defence use, it is common to write the ranks in abbreviated form using capital letters.

Don’t follow this convention in other types of content. Write the full rank with an initial capital letter.

#### Write this

Lieutenant T Smith \[Outside Defence\]

#### Not this

LT T Smith \[Defence only\]

Address members of the ADF correctly in emails and letters
----------------------------------------------------------

The style rule for address blocks applies to all members of the ADF.

The style rule for salutations changes with rank.

### Address blocks

To write an address block, follow all preceding rules on this page.

The style of address blocks is the same for all ranks.

*   rank
*   given name or initials
*   family name
*   post-nominals
*   ‘RAN’ for commissioned officers in the Navy
*   ‘(Retd)’for retired commissioned officers who retain rank
*   postal address.

#### Example

*   Brigadier Ana Duncan AM CSC  
    Commandant Royal Military College-Duntroon  
    Staff Cadet Avenue  
    Campbell ACT 2612
    
    Lieutenant General Gregory Bilton AO CSC  
    Chief Joint Operations  
    Headquarters Joint Operations Command (HQJOC)  
    PO Box 7928  
    Canberra BC ACT 2610
    
    His Excellency General the Honourable David Hurley AC DSC (Retd)  
    Governor-General of the Commonwealth of Australia  
    Government House  
    Dunrossil Drive  
    Yarralumla ACT 2600
    

### Salutations

The Style Manual follows the ADF’s style for salutations.

The style of salutations depends on [rank](#ranks).

Don’t include post-nominals in salutations.

Never add a comma after salutations.

#### Commissioned officer ranks

**Rule: Dear \[Rank\]**

Use the rule for these ranks:

*   Admiral, Rear Admiral, Commodore and Captain (Navy)
*   General, Lieutenant General, Major General, Brigadier and Colonel (Army)
*   Air Chief Marshal, Air Marshal, Air Vice-Marshal, Air Commodore and Group Captain (Air Force).

##### Example

*   Brigadier Ana Duncan AM CSC \[Address block\]
*   Dear Brigadier \[Salutation\]

**Rule: Dear \[Rank Family name\]**

Use the rule for these ranks:

*   Commander, Lieutenant Commander and Lieutenant (Navy)
*   Lieutenant Colonel, Major and Captain (Army)
*   Wing Commander, Squadron Leader and Flight Lieutenant (Air Force).

##### Example

*   Lieutenant Commander Siobhan Sturdy CSM RAN \[Address block\]
*   Dear Lieutenant Commander Sturdy \[Salutation\]

**Rule: Dear \[Honorific Family name\]**

Use the rule for these ranks:

*   Sub Lieutenant, Acting Sub Lieutenant and Midshipman (Navy)
*   Lieutenant, Second Lieutenant and Officer Cadet (Army)
*   Flying Officer, Pilot Officer and Officer Cadet (Air Force).

ADF style is to use a conventional title before the family name for these ranks.

Use the honorifics ‘Ms’, ‘Mr’, ‘Mx’, ‘Mrs’ or ‘Dr’ when it is possible to identify the appropriate title. If this is difficult, follow the ‘Dear \[Rank Family name\]' rule.

##### Example

*   Officer Cadet Dean Collins OAM \[Address block\]
*   Dear Mr Collins \[Preferred salutation\]
*   Dear Officer Cadet Collins \[Alternative salutation\]

#### Other ranks

**Rule: Dear \[Rank Family name\]**

Use the rule for ranks from:

*   Warrant Officer of the Navy to Recruit (Navy)
*   Regimental Sergeant Major of the Army to Recruit (Army)
*   Warrant officer of the Air Force to Aircraftman/Aircraftwoman (Air Force).

##### Example

*   Lance Corporal A Fenech BM \[Address block\]
*   Dear Lance Corporal Fenech \[Salutation\]

#### Chaplains and MSWOs

Salutations for ADF chaplains and maritime spiritual wellbeing officers do not change with rank.

**Rule: Dear \[Chaplaincy title\]**

**Rule: Dear \[MSWO title\]**

##### Example

*   Chaplain Jui-Hsiang Su CSM \[Address block\]  
    Dear Chaplain \[Salutation\]
    
    Principal Air Chaplain Rodger Boerth AM \[Address block\]  
    Dear Principal Air Chaplain \[Salutation\]

Release notes
-------------

Guidance in the digital edition broadly follows the _Australian Defence Force writing manual_ (an internal Defence resource). There are also style conventions in the writing manual that the digital edition does not follow.

The digital edition consolidates information from the sixth edition and provides updated examples. It has advice on capitalisation for internal military use that was not in the sixth edition.

The digital edition outlines the order of precedence for the armed services and includes new guidance about maritime spiritual wellbeing officers.

The sixth edition had a table of armed service ranks in Australia. The digital edition has a table of ranks and associated salutation rules.

Examples in the digital edition do not follow the sixth edition’s requirement for a comma before and between post-nominals. This is consistent with this edition’s recommendation to use minimal punctuation.

The Content Guide did not have information about forms of address and ranks for the ADF.
