Security classifications and protective markings
================================================

Use protective markings for government information. Follow your organisation’s procedures to add them.

Add protective markings to government information
-------------------------------------------------

If you are working with government information, follow organisational procedures to assess and apply protective markings to sensitive and classified information.

The protective marking will usually be in all capitals at the top and bottom of a page.

Information is assessed and given protective marking to identify if it is sensitive or security classified.

*   Information might be identified as ‘Unofficial’, ‘Official’ or ‘Official: Sensitive’.
*   Information might be security classified as ‘Protected’, ‘Secret’ or ‘Top Secret’.
*   Other protective markings include caveats (such as codewords and special handling instructions) and information management markers. Caveat markings are mandatory and information management markers are optional.

All sensitive and security classified information, including emails, carry protective markings. Information metadata is also marked.

Protective Security Policy Framework (PSPF) requirements include how the information is classified and marked, and what this means for its storage, handling, access and disposal. For more information, [consult the PSPF webpages](https://www.protectivesecurity.gov.au/policies/information-security). Or consult your organisation’s protective security policy.

### Security classification requirements

The Protective Security Policy Framework (PSPF) explains [how protective markings should be formatted](https://www.protectivesecurity.gov.au/publications-library/policy-8-classification-system). To achieve clearly identifiable protective markings, the PSPF recommends:

*   using capitals, bold text, large font and a distinctive colour (red preferred)
*   placing markings at the centre top and bottom of each page
*   separating markings by a double forward slash to help clearly differentiate each marking.

When you write for the Australian Government, be aware of [PSPF requirements for government information](https://www.protectivesecurity.gov.au/policies/information-security). Follow organisational procedures to apply security classifications and protective markings to content before referring to the PSPF.

Agency implementation of the PSPF is supported by the [Department of Home Affairs](https://www.protectivesecurity.gov.au/).

Use initial capitals to write about protective markings
-------------------------------------------------------

In general content, use an initial capital unless you are reporting how the protective marking actually appears on the page. In that instance, write the marking as it appears and use quotation marks.

### Example

Only those with an existing Negative Vetting 1 security clearance are considered for supervised temporary access to Top Secret information.

The field report was stamped ‘TOP SECRET’.
