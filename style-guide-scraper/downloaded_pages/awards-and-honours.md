Awards and honours
==================

Post-nominals and titles of status show the awards and honours an individual has. List them in the correct order.  

Use post-nominals in the correct order
--------------------------------------

Post-nominals are the shortened forms for academic awards and civil and military honours.

There is an [order in which to write the post-nominals](https://www.pmc.gov.au/resource-centre/government/post-nominals).

In summary, the rule is to write the highest honour first. The order is:

*   post-nominals for honours and awards
*   King’s Counsel (KC) or Senior Counsel (SC) or Justice of the Peace (JP)
*   university degrees and diplomas
*   membership of professional associations
*   membership of parliament.

Don’t use:

*   full stops or spaces within post-nominals
*   commas before or between post-nominals.

### Example

*   Professor Fiona Wood AM FAHMS
*   The Hon Ken Wyatt AM MP
*   The Hon Linda Burney MP

Write titles before a person’s name in the correct order
--------------------------------------------------------

Vice-regal and ecclesiastical titles and Australian Defence Force ranks usually precede all other titles.

Follow these with any other titles (such as ‘Dame’, ‘Sir’ and ‘Dr’) immediately before a person’s name.

### Example

*   His Excellency General the Honourable David Hurley AC DSC (Retd)
*   The Right Reverend Dr Sarah Macneil
*   General Sir John Wilton KBE CB DSO

Release notes
-------------

The reference to ‘King’s Counsel’ replaced the reference to ‘Queen’s Counsel’ upon the death of Queen Elizabeth II.

The digital edition consolidates information from the sixth edition and uses topic-specific pages to help users find what they need. It includes updated examples.

The sixth edition had substantial information on awards and honours spread throughout the manual, but concentrated in an appendix.

Examples in the digital edition do not follow the sixth edition’s requirement for a comma before and between post-nominals. This is consistent with this edition’s recommendation to use minimal punctuation.

The Content Guide had brief guidance for punctuating abbreviations of honours, awards and distinctions. The digital edition is consistent with that guidance.
