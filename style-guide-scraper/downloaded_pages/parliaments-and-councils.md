Parliaments and councils
========================

Refer to members of Australian parliaments and councils in the correct style. Follow these rules to address and title people correctly.

Capitalise the titles of the current prime minister and treasurer
-----------------------------------------------------------------

Capitalise the titles of the current holders of the positions of:

*   Prime Minister
*   Treasurer.

Do this even when the titles are abbreviated.

If referencing prime ministers or treasurers generically, use lower case.

### Example

*   The Prime Minister announced the new initiative this morning.
*   The PM announced the new initiative this morning. \[Less formal\]
*   Terms of office vary for prime ministers around the world. \[Generic\]
*   The Treasurer will present the mid-year report tomorrow.
*   In many countries treasurers are preparing responses to this latest development. \[Generic\]

Use lower case letters for former prime ministers and treasurers of Australia.

### Example

*   Alfred Deakin served 3 terms as prime minister of Australia.
*   Australia’s first female prime minister was Julia Gillard, who took office in 2010.
*   Peter Costello remains the longest-serving treasurer in Australian history.

Capitalise titles for current senators and members of the Australian Parliament
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The Parliament of Australia website has instructions for [how to address senators and members](https://www.aph.gov.au/Senators_and_Members/Contacting_Senators_and_Members/How_to_address_Senators_and_Members).

Write these titles as follows:

*   the Prime Minister
*   the President of the Senate
*   the Speaker of the House of Representatives
*   ministers (Senate)
*   ministers (House of Representatives)
*   assistant ministers (Senate)
*   assistant ministers (House of Representatives)
*   senators
*   members (House of Representatives).

People elected to the upper house take the title ‘Senator’ before their given name.

### Example

*   Senator Claire Chandler

Members of the House of Representatives take the initialism ‘MP’ after their name. Write it after any other post-nominals. Don’t use commas before or between post-nominals.

### Example

*   Ms Zali Steggall OAM MP

Address certain office holders of the Australian Parliament as ‘Honourable’
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Use the title ‘Honourable’ for ministers (including the prime minister) and parliamentary secretaries in the Australian Parliament. The title is given to these office holders because they are members of the [Federal Executive Council](https://www.aph.gov.au/About_Parliament/House_of_Representatives/Powers_practice_and_procedure/Practice7/HTML/Chapter2/Federal_Executive_Council). They retain the title for life.

The abbreviation for ‘Honourable’ is ‘Hon’ without a full stop.

### Example

*   The Hon Chris Bowen MP, Minister for Climate Change and Energy \[Serving minister\]
*   The Hon Darren Chester MP \[Serving MP and former minister\]
*   The Hon Warren Entsch MP \[Serving MP and former parliamentary secretary\]

Use the title ‘Senator’ before ‘the Honourable’ if the minister or parliamentary secretary is a member of the Senate.

### Example

*   Senator the Hon Penny Wong, Minister for Foreign Affairs

### The presiding officers and former office holders of state parliaments

The President of the Senate and the Speaker of the House of Representatives (the presiding officers) use the title ‘Honourable’.

‘Honourable’ is also given to members of the Australian Parliament who are:

*   former members of state ministries
*   former presiding officers of state parliaments.

#### Example

*   Senator the Hon Susan Lines, President of the Senate
*   The Hon Milton Dick MP, Speaker of the House of Representatives
*   The Hon Bob Katter MP \[Former minister in the Queensland Government\]

In formal emails and letters to a minister:

*   Open with ‘Dear Minister’.
*   Conclude with ‘Yours faithfully’.

In less formal correspondence:

*   Open with ‘My dear Minister’.
*   Conclude with ‘Yours sincerely’.

Use the appropriate form for members of state and territory parliaments
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

In formal emails and letters, address members of state and territory parliaments with the relevant post-nominal after their name.

### Number of chambers in state and territory parliament

The parliaments of all states except Qld are ‘bicameral’. This means parliament has 2 chambers or houses:

*   the Legislative Council – also called the ‘upper house’
*   the Legislative Assembly (NSW, Vic and WA) or House of Assembly (SA and Tas) – also called the ‘lower house’.

The parliaments of Qld, the ACT and the NT are ‘unicameral’. This means parliament has one chamber or house – the Legislative Assembly.

### Use the correct post-nominal

Members of state and territory parliaments use the post-nominal:

*   MLC (Member of the Legislative Council)
*   MLA (Member of the Legislative Assembly)
*   MP (Member of the Legislative Assembly or Member of the House of Assembly).

All bicameral parliaments use the post-nominal 'MLC' for members of their upper houses.

The choice of 'MLA' or 'MP' for members of state and territory parliaments is less clear-cut.

Follow these rules to use the correct post-nominal.

Use MLC for members of the Legislative Council of:

*   NSW
*   SA
*   Tas
*   Vic
*   WA.

Use MLA for members of the Legislative Assembly of:

*   ACT
*   NT
*   WA.

Use MP for members of the Legislative Assembly of:

*   NSW
*   Qld
*   Vic.

Use MP for members of the House of Assembly of:

*   SA
*   Tas.

### Example

*   The Hon Nicolas Pierre Goiran MLC
*   Ms Tara Cheyne MLA
*   Mr Danny O'Brien MP
*   Dr Amy MacMahon MP 

A parliamentarian may have other post-nominals after their name. These can include:

*   civilian and military honours
*   educational and professional qualifications.

If so, write these in the same way the parliamentarian does. If you’re unsure, check with the parliamentarian’s office.

### Emails and letters to members of a state or territory parliament

In formal correspondence with a member of a state or territory parliament:

*   Open with ‘Dear Ms’ (or ‘Mr’, ‘Mrs’, ‘Mx’, ‘Dr’ and so on).
*   Conclude with ‘Yours faithfully’.

In less formal correspondence:

*   Open with ‘Dear Mr’ (or ‘Ms’, ‘Mrs’, ‘Mx’, ‘Dr’ and so on).
*   Conclude with ‘Yours sincerely’.

### Address certain office holders in state and NT parliaments as ‘Honourable’

Use ‘Honourable’ when addressing all members of the executive councils of the states and the NT:

*   premiers and ministers in all states
*   chief minister and ministers in the NT
*   former ministers in all states and the NT.

Use ‘Honourable’ when addressing these parliamentarians:

*   members of all state legislative councils except in Vic
*   Leader of the Opposition in Tas
*   presidents of all legislative councils
*   speakers of all parliaments except in the ACT.

#### Example

*   NSW: The Hon Benjamin Cameron Franklin MLC, President of the Legislative Council
*   NT: The Hon Mark Monaghan MLA, Speaker of the Legislative Assembly
*   Qld: The Hon Scott Stewart MP, Minister for Resources \[Serving minister\]
*   SA: The Hon Jing Shyuan Lee MLC \[Member of the Legislative Council\]
*   Tas: The Hon Rebecca White MP, Leader of the Opposition
*   Vic: The Hon Daniel Andrews MP, Premier of Victoria
*   WA: The Hon Sophia Moermond MLC \[Member of the Legislative Council\]

Office holders in the ACT Legislative Assembly don’t use the title ‘Honourable’. Ministers in the ACT have more than one portfolio. Address emails and letters to them using the ministerial title appropriate to the topic.

#### Example

*   Ms Joy Burch MLA, Speaker of the ACT Legislative Assembly
*   Ms Rachel Stephen-Smith MLA, Minister for Health
*   Ms Rachel Stephen-Smith MLA, Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs
*   Ms Rachel Stephen-Smith MLA,  Minister for Families and Community Services

### Address state premiers correctly

Address state premiers as ‘The Hon \[given and family names\] MLA/MP, Premier of …’

Check the premier’s website to see whether they include other post-nominals in their title, such as academic or professional qualifications.

#### Example

*   The Hon Peter Malinauskas MP, Premier of South Australia
*   The Hon Roger Cook BA GradDipBus (PR) MBA MLA, Premier of Western Australia

In formal emails and letters with a premier:

*   Open with ‘Dear Premier’.

Address mayors and members of local governments with the correct title

Release notes
-------------

The digital edition consolidates information in the sixth edition and provides updated examples.

The digital edition removes the sixth edition’s requirement to use full stops with the abbreviation of ‘The Honourable’ to ‘The Hon’.

This change is supported by evidence from Australian corpora and is consistent with the digital edition’s recommendation to use minimal punctuation.

For the same reason, digital edition examples do not follow the sixth edition’s requirement for a comma before and between post-nominals.

The Content Guide has brief information about titles for members of federal, state, territory and local governments.
