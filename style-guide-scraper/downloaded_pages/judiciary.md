Release notes
-------------

The digital edition includes information from the sixth edition with updated examples.

The digital edition removes the sixth edition’s requirement to use full stops with the abbreviation of ‘The Honourable’ to ‘The Hon’.

This change is supported by evidence from Australian corpora and is consistent with the digital edition’s recommendation to use minimal punctuation.

For the same reason, digital edition examples do not follow the sixth edition’s requirement for a comma before and between post-nominals.

The Content Guide did not include information on titles for the judiciary.
