Authoritative reports
=====================

Case citations rely on authorised and unauthorised law report series. Use the correct abbreviations for Australian law report series. This will help people find the judgements you cite.  

Cite an authorised law report if one is available
-------------------------------------------------

When you are referring to case law, you will generally cite a law report.

There are Commonwealth, state and territory law reports. They contain court judgments in cases that are important for legal reasons.

Reported cases generally set a precedent for similar cases. A written judgement is a useful summary of the key points of a case.

Not all court decisions are published. Where they are not published, they are called unreported judgments. Unreported judgments are less persuasive than reported judgments.

### Authorised and unauthorised reports

Citations use common abbreviations for the titles of law reports. A law report is part of either an authorised or unauthorised report series.

The courts review, annotate and approve authorised law reports for publication. Wherever you can, cite an authorised law report using the relevant abbreviation.

Unauthorised law reports are legitimate reports that haven’t gone through the same process before publication. Tribunals and smaller courts often have unauthorised reports. These can be the only available reports of those decisions.
