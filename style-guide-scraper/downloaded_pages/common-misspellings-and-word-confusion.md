Common misspellings and word confusion
======================================

When words sound similar or the same, people can confuse their spelling. If you’re not sure about the spelling of a word, check a dictionary.  

Check for words that are easily confused or misspelt
----------------------------------------------------

The spelling of some words is variable. Sometimes it’s difficult to know which spelling or word to use because:

*   Australian, American and British English have different ways of spelling a word
*   a word might sound similar to another, so people can mishear it and write the wrong word.

Follow one dictionary for consistency and use it to check variable [spellings](/node/30).

Choose the right word and spell it correctly
