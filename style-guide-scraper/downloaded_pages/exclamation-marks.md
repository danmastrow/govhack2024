Exclamation marks
=================

Exclamation marks show emphasis and convey emotion. Only use them in informal content.  

Don’t use exclamation marks in general
--------------------------------------

Exclamation marks aren’t part of [government voice](/node/40). Don’t use exclamation marks in formal content, such as government reports or briefings.

In general use, exclamation marks can emphasise:

*   statements
*   emotions
*   greetings
*   commands
*   rhetorical questions.

### Example

*   That can’t be true!
*   Stand at ease!

Use them sparingly in less formal content such as promotional material and social media posts. Be aware that exclamation marks can create a sense of panic or stress.

Exclamation marks often appear ‘as themselves’ in instructions to users of government services.

### Example

Write one exclamation mark: don’t overuse them
----------------------------------------------

Don’t use exclamation marks too often. Exclamation marks can lose their emphasis if you use too many.

At the end of each sentence you want to emphasise, use only one exclamation mark.

Some people use multiple exclamation marks in [social media](/node/43). This is not suitable for government content.

The digital edition has the same advice as the sixth edition about exclamation marks. The only addition is a reminder to use only one exclamation mark instead of several.

The sixth edition had a brief section of exclamation marks in the chapter on sentence punctuation.

The Content Guide recommended against the use of exclamation marks for government content.
