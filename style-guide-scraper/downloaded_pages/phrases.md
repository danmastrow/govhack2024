Phrases are groups of words with a specific function
----------------------------------------------------

A phrase is a group of words that makes sense on its own but doesn’t contain a subject and a verb.

Phrases can only add meaning to a sentence. They can’t stand on their own.

Types of phrases include:

*   noun phrases
*   adverbial phrases
*   adjectival phrases.

Noun phrases function as nouns
------------------------------

A noun phrase is a group of words that works in a sentence as a [noun](/node/122). A noun phrase always includes a noun. It can also include determiners, adjectives, adverbs and other nouns.

### Example

Our well-prepared colleague entered the meeting room.

\[The phrase ‘our well-prepared colleague’ works as the noun in the sentence. This phrase contains the determiner ‘our’, the adjective ‘well-prepared’ and the noun ‘colleague’.\]

She was well suited to life in an office.

\[The phrase ‘life in an office’ works as the noun in the sentence. This phrase contains the noun ‘life’, the preposition ‘in’, the determiner ‘an’ and the noun ‘office’.\]

### Possessive phrases

A possessive phrase is a particular type of noun phrase. It shows that one noun in the phrase belongs to another noun in the phrase. Possessive phrases usually have an apostrophe.

#### Example

I thought it was someone else’s problem.

\[The problem belongs to someone else.\]

This was one of the commander-in-chief’s first orders to the troops.

\[The first orders belong to the commander-in-chief.\]

### Non-possessive and generic phrases

Non-possessive and generic phrases use plural nouns as adjectives. No apostrophes are needed.

#### Example

She signed the visitors book_._

\[The book doesn’t belong to the visitors. The word ‘visitors’ describes the type of book.\]

The Historic Shipwrecks Delegates Committee met once a year.

\[The committee is made up of delegates. The name of the committee relates to the _Historic Shipwrecks Act 1976_.\]

Adverbial phrases function as adverbs
-------------------------------------

An adverbial phrase is a group of words that describes a verb, adjective or other [adverb](/node/127).

### Example

Grammar rules are quite frequently misunderstood.

\[The phrase ‘quite frequently’ modifies the adjective ‘misunderstood’.\]

Best of all, we can tick this off the list.

\[The phrase ‘best of all’ modifies the main clause ‘we can tick this off the list’.\] 

Adverbial phrases can describe the manner of or reason for a verb’s action.

### Example

We’ll do this by the rules. \[Adverbial phrase of manner\]

We came inside because of the rain. \[Adverbial phrase of reason\]

Adverbial phrases can also describe time and place. These are known as ‘prepositional phrases’. Prepositional phrases consist of:

*   the preposition
*   any adjectives or determiners that accompany it.

### Example

I’ll see you after knock-off time. \[Adverbial phrase of time\]

The manual sat on the shelf. \[Adverbial phrase of place\]

Adjectival phrases function as adjectives
-----------------------------------------

An adjectival phrase is a group of words that works as an [adjective](/node/126). It modifies a pronoun, noun or noun phrase.

### Example

The staff showcased their work on the new project.

\[The phrase ‘on the new project’ describes the staff’s work.\]

Adjectival phrases that modify a pronoun, noun or noun phrase can also appear after the verb ‘to be’.

### Example

They are eager to hear good news.

\[The phrase ‘eager to hear good news’ describes the pronoun ‘they’.\]

The developer was categorical about accessibility requirements.

\[The phrase ‘categorical about accessibility requirements’ describes the noun phrase ‘the developer’.\]

Adjectival phrases can start with a preposition. They are also known as prepositional phrases.

### Example

The top line in the budget report showed a deficit.

\[The preposition ‘in’ starts the prepositional phrase ‘in the budget report’, which describes ‘the top line’.\]
