Literacy and access
===================

Literacy can be a barrier to access for Australian users. Writing to an Australian year 7 level makes content usable for most people.

Literacy affects access to government services and information
--------------------------------------------------------------

Literacy is a person’s ability to read and write. It is also how well they can access written text in digital and print formats.

The effect of literacy on people’s lives is profound. It influences how they interact with each other and how they approach education, work and government.

Low literacy can make it hard to access government services and information.

Factors that affect literacy in English include:

*   where people live
*   their [linguistic background](/node/59)
*   their education
*   how old they are
*   their [abilities and limitations](/node/69)
*   how they access information.

### Accessibility requirements

User need:

I can read and understand text, even if the content includes unusual words, shortened forms, or features languages other than English.

Fundamentals:

*   Write in plain language. This helps all users and is essential for some.
*   Level AAA requires a lower secondary education reading level, after removal of proper names and titles (year 7 or between 12 and 14 years old).
*   Avoid (or explain) unusual words, phrases, idioms and so on.
*   Expand all acronyms on their first use.
*   Avoid using double negatives.

Web Content Accessibility Guidelines success criteria:

*   [3.1.5 Reading level – level AAA](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/quickref/#reading-level)
*   [3.1.3 Unusual words – level AAA](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/quickref/#unusual-words)
*   [3.1.4 Abbreviations – level AAA](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/quickref/#abbreviations)

### Reading levels in Australia

‘Reading level’ is the level of education someone needs to be able to read text. It is one way to measure literacy.

In Australia:

*   about 44% of adults read at literacy level 1 to 2 (a low level)
*   38% of adults read at level 3
*   about 15% read at level 4 to 5 (the highest level).

People at a reading level 1 read at a primary school equivalent level. They can understand short sentences.

### Education and literacy

People with higher literacy – as measured by reading level – generally have had access to a better education.

Many factors influence people’s access to education, including where they live.

Post-school education is easier to access if you live in a major city. For example, people in cities are more likely to have a bachelor degree than people in regional areas. But there are also areas of disadvantage in the major cities.

An education doesn’t guarantee a reading level that matches the qualification. For example, about 30% of Australians have a diploma or higher, but only 1.2% of Australians can read at that level.

Many people maintain their high-school reading level even if they go on to tertiary studies.

Clear content helps all users
-----------------------------

Regardless of literacy levels, all users want to be able to interact with government easily. Respect their time by writing in [plain language](/node/55). Check that your content is a reading level 2 (Australian year 7 equivalent). This level also helps users with higher literacy. 

Users with higher education also prefer content that’s easy to read. People with the highest literacy levels tend to be time-poor and have the most to read. The preference for plain English increases with:

*   a person’s level of education
*   the complexity of the topic.

Content for general consumption needs to be accessible by everyone, regardless of literacy. Specialist content is more accessible for technical users when written in plain language.

### Understanding users

Before you start writing, do [user research](/node/76). Don’t assume that everyone can access, read and understand what you write.

Always make it simple for people to get what they need to do with government done. People might need an alternative to the digital service.

#### Digital Service Standard requirements

You must understand the needs of all users of your service and create content they can access to meet the Digital Service Standard:

*   [Criterion 1. Understand user needs](https://www.dta.gov.au/help-and-advice/digital-service-standard/digital-service-standard-criteria/1-understand-user-needs)
*   [Criterion 9. Make it accessible](https://www.dta.gov.au/help-and-advice/digital-service-standard/digital-service-standard-criteria/9-make-it-accessible).

Ensure that people who use the digital service can also use the other available channels, if needed, without repetition or confusion.

Do user research to understand how people interact with government services or information. Ensure users with low literacy have equal access.

[Criterion 12. Don’t forget the non-digital experience](https://www.dta.gov.au/help-and-advice/digital-service-standard/digital-service-standard-criteria/12-dont-forget-non-digital-experience)
