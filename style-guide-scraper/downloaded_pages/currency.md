Currency
========

Use the correct numbers, words and symbols for currency so people are clear about the amount.

Quantify an amount of money with a symbol and numeral
-----------------------------------------------------

Write amounts using the relevant currency symbol followed by numerals. Don’t put a space between the currency symbol and the numerals.

### Example

*   $27.99

For an amount less than $1, you can write it either as a whole number of cents or as a [decimal value](/node/146#use_0_before_a_decimal_point_for_values_less_than_one).

For the cents form:

*   Use the letter ‘c’ for cents after the numerals.
*   Don’t add a space between the numerals and the ‘c’_._
*   Don’t use a full stop after the ‘c’ unless it’s at the end of a sentence.

### Example

*   $0.50
*   50c

If the amount is a decimal number, always use 2 digits after the decimal point.

### Example

*   $0.80
*   $0.78

If the amount is less than 10 cents, use a zero before the number of cents.

### Correct

*   $0.04

### Incorrect

*   $0.4

Clarify when you are using Australian dollars
---------------------------------------------

Where content is clearly only referencing Australian dollars, use ‘$’.

### Example

The minimum wage in Australia is $19.49 per hour.

If users could be confused about the currency being referenced, place ‘A’ before the ‘$’. Don’t insert a space between them.

### Example

The minimum wage in Australia is A$19.49 per hour. \[Use of ‘A’ is appropriate if the content is intended for users outside Australia.\]

The journalist was paid A$89 per hour during her posting in Hong Kong. \[Use of ‘A’ helps users understand that the journalist was not paid in Hong Kong dollars\].

Reference non-Australian currencies for accessibility
-----------------------------------------------------

Non-Australian currency symbols may be inaccessible to people who access content using screen readers. Screen readers may be unable to interpret and describe the symbols. Avoid the use of non-Australian currency symbols where possible.

### Options for referencing non-Australian currencies

Use the 3-letter International Bank Account Number [(IBAN) currency codes](https://www.iban.com/currency-codes) – for example, THB, USD, VND. This is the preferred method because it doesn’t use symbols and makes content more accessible.

When referencing ‘dollar’ currencies, use a country prefix followed by the ‘$’ symbol – for example, A$, C$, NZ$, US$. If there is any chance of confusion, use the 3-letter IBAN codes.

Use the currency symbol only, for example ‘£’ for the British pound, if you have evidence that it is the best way to meet a user need.

### Using IBAN currency codes (preferred)

Use them for all currencies referenced in the content (including Australian dollars).

Don’t place a space between the IBAN currency code and the numerals.

Use the same number of decimal places for all the currencies you refer to.

#### Example

Minimum wages are currently:

*   Australia – AUD19.49 per hour
*   Thailand – THB313.00 per day
*   Vanuatu – VUV220.00 per hour
*   Vietnam – VND4.18 million per month (urban Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh City).

If using foreign currency symbols:

*   Explain them on first use unless they are very widely known (for example, US$).
*   Place them before the numerals and don’t insert a space.
*   Don’t also use the IBAN currency code.

#### Write this

The minimum wage in Japan is currently Japanese yen (¥) 901 per hour. It was previously ¥874 per hour. \[The Japanese yen symbol isn’t very widely known in Australia, so explain it at first mention unless you're writing for a specialist audience familiar with the symbol.\]

The minimum wage in the United States is currently US$7.25 per hour. \[Because US$ is very widely known, don’t explain it on first use.\]

#### Not this

The minimum wage in the United States is currently $7.25 USD per hour. \[Don’t use both the currency symbol and the IBAN currency code. This also applies when writing Australian dollar amounts.\]

### Former Australian currency units

Use words rather than symbols for former Australian currency.

Before 14 February 1966, pounds (£), shillings (s) and pence (d) were Australia’s units of currency. Few people would recognise these symbols now, so write them out in full.

#### Write this

9 pounds, 8 shillings and 7 pence

Not this

£9 8s 7d

Some countries still use pounds as their currency. If there is any chance of confusion, state ‘former Australian pounds’ or use the symbol ‘A£’.

Quantify large amounts of money
-------------------------------

Use the level of precision needed for the content.

### Example

*   They spent more than $2.1 million. \[Use in descriptive text.\]
*   Total expenditure was $2.195 million. \[Use in a financial report.\]
*   $2.195m \[Use in a table or chart. No space or full stop. Explain the shortened form ‘m’ in a note.\]

Use words for inexact amounts
-----------------------------

Use words for amounts of money that are an expression rather than an actual amount.

### Example

*   This approach is likely to save thousands of dollars.
*   The contract was worth several million dollars.

Release notes
-------------

The digital edition recommends using the dollar symbol and numerals most cases for Australian currency. It gives three options for citing foreign currencies supported by a search of Australian corpora. It recommends avoiding non-Australian currency symbols where possible and using words instead of symbols when referring to former Australian currency.

The sixth edition gave the option of using a combination of words and numbers for currency in descriptive and narrative prose.

The Content Guide did not have guidance on the style for currency.
