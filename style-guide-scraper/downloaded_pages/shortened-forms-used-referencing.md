Shortened forms used in referencing
===================================

Shortened forms are used in referencing to help people quickly identify sources. Unlike other shortened forms, some Latin shortened forms retain full stops.  
  

Use roman type, not italics
---------------------------

In referencing, present shortened forms in roman type (not italics). Always start them with a lower case letter, even when they are derived from Latin words.

Only some Latin shortened forms and ‘n.d.’ take full stops.

Avoid Latin shortened forms in referencing systems
--------------------------------------------------

The terms ‘ibid.’, ‘op. cit.’, ‘loc. cit.’ and ‘id.’ are sometimes used in the documentary–note system and other styles of referencing.

This is no longer common usage. These terms should be avoided unless they are required by a publisher.

The term ‘ibid.’ refers users to the same publication that was cited immediately before it. It can refer to the same page or to a different one.

### Example

1.  R Hyslop, _Aye aye, Minister_, AGPS Press, Canberra, 1990, p 89.
2.  ibid.
3.  ibid., p 160.

\[These 3 references all cite the same publication (Hyslop’s _Aye aye, Minister_). The third reference cites a different page number.\]

The term ‘op. cit.’ refers users back to information from different pages in the same publication. The difference between ‘ibid.’ and ‘op. cit.’ is that there can be several references between the first mention of the publication and later mentions.

### Example

1.  R Hyslop, _Aye aye, Minister_, AGPS Press, Canberra, 1990, p 89.
2.  ... \[works by other authors\]
3.  R Hyslop, op. cit., p 171.

\[Two of the references use information from different pages in the same publication (Hyslop’s _Aye aye, Minister_, pages 89 and 171).\]

The term ‘loc. cit.’ refers the reader back to the same page of a publication already cited.

### Example

1.  R Hyslop, _Aye aye, Minister_, AGPS Press, Canberra, 1990, p 89.
2.  ... \[works by other authors\]
3.  R Hyslop, loc. cit.

\[Both references use information from page 89 of the same publication (Hyslop’s _Aye aye, Minister_).\]

The term ‘id.’ signifies that the work in the second note is by the same author as the work in the first note.

### Example

1.  R Hyslop, _Aye aye, Minister_, AGPS Press, Canberra, 1990, p 89.
2.  id., _Australian mandarins: perceptions of the role of departmental secretaries_, AGPS Press, Canberra, 1993, p 45.

\[Both works are by R Hyslop.\]

Release notes
-------------

The digital edition consolidates information on shortened forms used in referencing. The digital edition advises not to use these abbreviations unless required to by a publisher.

It advises against using most Latin shortened forms in referencing. This is a change from the sixth edition, but is consistent with advice in the digital edition to [avoid Latin shortened forms](/node/91).

The digital edition advises to use English abbreviations without full stops in citations, with the exception of ‘n.d.’, consistent with updated guidance for [use of abbreviations](/node/184). The full stops in ‘n.d.’ are retained in line with all other commonly used referencing systems.

The Content Guide did not include information about shortened forms in referencing. It advised against using Latin shortened forms.
