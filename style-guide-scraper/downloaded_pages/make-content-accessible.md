Make content accessible
=======================

People can experience ongoing, temporary or situational barriers to access information they need. Help them by designing accessible and inclusive content.

Make content accessible
-----------------------

Accessibility is about inclusion.

Government services and products need to be available to everyone. This means creating inclusive content.

Inclusive content recognises:

*   Australia’s diversity
*   the diversity of technology Australians use to engage online.

For example, inclusive content accommodates:

*   cultural and linguistic diversity among users
*   diversity of abilities among users
*   how users interact with technology in different contexts.

The Australian Government's aim is that all government services are digital first. This aim is described in the [Government Digital Strategy](https://www.dta.gov.au/digital-government-strategy).

Australian Government digital services must be usable and accessible – a requirement under the [Digital Service Standard](https://www.dta.gov.au/help-and-advice/about-digital-service-standard).  

Follow accessibility guidance in context
----------------------------------------

Style Manual topics give you the guidance you need to follow to create accessible content. Where there are specific accessibility requirements or guidance, the Style Manual provides callouts to make it clear what you need to do.

### Example

This is an example of an accessibility callout.

Style Manual guidance
---------------------

In addition to this contextual guidance, the Style Manual also provides information on:

*   designing for accessibility and inclusion
*   applying the principles of the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG)
*   the responsibilities of government agencies.

This guidance supports agencies in meeting accessibility requirements. The Style Manual does not provide technical guidance or support for developers and site owners on meeting specific accessibility requirements.

Release notes
-------------

The digital edition recognises accessibility as an integral aspect of government content.

The sixth edition mentioned the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) but did not go into detail about how to implement accessibility in relation to writing and editing.

Content Guide had an overview on accessibility that referred to specific success criteria in WCAG.
