Semicolons
==========

Semicolons link sentences. They complicate sentences for users if overused. Do not use them at the end of bullet and numbered list items.

Avoid using a semicolon to link sentences
-----------------------------------------

Short, simple sentences are easier to read. Overusing semicolons makes writing more difficult to understand.

Semicolons can create a break that is stronger than a comma but weaker than a full stop. They can link 2 sentences that share or develop an idea. The information must be closely related.

### Example

*   He wrote a report for each group. The red report was for one group; the blue report was for the other.
*   Sometimes it’s optional; sometimes it’s compulsory.

Instead of a semicolon, it’s usually best to use either:

*   a full stop followed by a new sentence
*   a comma before the last item, followed by a [conjunction](/node/129).

Sentences should be in plain language and no longer than 25 words. Don’t use a semicolon if all it does is make your sentence longer.

### Write this

Find out if it’s optional or compulsory before you start. Ask someone to help you if you don’t know the difference.

### Not this

Find out if it’s optional or compulsory before you start; ask someone to help you if you don’t know the difference.

Too much punctuation makes text crowded and difficult to read. If a sentence has a lot of punctuation marks, it might be a sign that the sentence is too long or complex. Try to rewrite into [shorter, clearer sentences](/node/204).

If you have to use a semicolon, on both sides of the semicolon write [full sentences](/node/120). Other than in some sentence lists, it’s incorrect to have a sentence fragment on one side of the semicolon.

### Correct

Staff can leave at any time; they don’t need a work schedule.

### Incorrect

Staff can leave at any time; no work schedule. 

Don’t end bullet and numbered list items with semicolons
--------------------------------------------------------

You don’t need a semicolon at the end of each list item for bullet and numbered [lists](/node/56). It clutters the list and makes it hard to read.

### Like this

The successful applicant will demonstrate:

*   integrity, persistence and good judgement
*   experience in projects of this type
*   a sound understanding of interdepartmental relationships.

### Not this

The successful applicant will demonstrate:

*   integrity, persistence and good judgement;
*   experience in projects of this type; and
*   a sound understanding of interdepartmental relationships.

Separate in-text references with semicolons
-------------------------------------------

Use a semicolon between each reference when you have more than one in-text [reference in brackets](/node/181).

### Example

Effective leaders are adaptable (Nicoll 2019; Taylor 2018; Weir 2020).

Use a bullet or numbered list instead of semicolons in a complex sentence
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

Complex lists in sentences can be hard to read. If you can’t use a bullet or numbered list, separate list items with:

*   commas if the list is simple, such as a list of single words
*   semicolons if the list is complex, such as a list of items that already contain commas or conjunctions.

In complex lists, you need semicolons to show what goes with what.

It is almost always better to break a complex list into a bullet or numbered list to make it easier to read.

### Example

The successful applicant will demonstrate integrity, persistence and confidence. \[No semicolon is needed, as each item is a single word or phrase with no other punctuation.\]

The successful applicant will demonstrate integrity, persistence and confidence; experience in projects of this type; and a sound understanding of interdepartmental relationships. \[Semicolons are needed, as some list items have a comma in them.\]

The project will go ahead in Rose Bay, Tasmania; West End, Queensland; and Fitzroy North, Victoria. \[Semicolons are needed, as some list items have a comma in them.\]

Release notes
-------------

The digital edition is consistent with the sixth edition in its advice on semicolons. A minor change is that it promotes use of other punctuation marks instead.

The Content Guide recommended avoiding semicolons. Sources cited as evidence support the uses explained in the digital edition.
