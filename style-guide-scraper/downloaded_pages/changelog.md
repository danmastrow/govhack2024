February to April 2024
----------------------

**Major revision**

[Dates and time](https://www.stylemanual.gov.au/grammar-punctuation-and-conventions/numbers-and-measurements/dates-and-time)

‘Dates and time’ has a new structure, revised guidance, new content and updated examples.  
To ensure the Changelog is readable, we list major changes only. Minor changes have been logged internally.

##### Rule changes

*   **Shortened forms for months and days of the week** – We allow more contractions for use as standard abbreviations: ‘Tue’ ‘Thur’ ‘Thu’ ‘Jun’ ‘Jul’ ‘Sep’.
*   **World wars** – The amended rule replaces the distinction between Australian and American styles with 2 acceptable styles: ‘First World War’ and ‘World War I’. Our recommendation to use roman numerals is based on corpus evidence, but we acknowledge the use of ‘1’ and ‘2’ by some agencies.
    
    There is a rule change for the shortened form. We now recommend using roman numerals not arabic numerals – write ‘WWII’ not ‘WW2’. 
    
*   **Centuries** – Write all centuries with numerals (3rd century). Under the previous rule, both words (third century) or numerals (3rd century) were acceptable style. Evidence supporting the change came from expert advice and corpus data.
    
    We have added an exception for centuries to the relevant rule on the ‘[Ordinal numbers](https://www.stylemanual.gov.au/grammar-punctuation-and-conventions/numbers-and-measurements/ordinal-numbers#use_words_for_ordinals_up_to_ninth_and_numerals_for_10th_and_above)’ page.
    
*   **Time zones** – The initialisms for time zones now appear after the time (13:45 AEST) not before the time (AEST 13:45).

##### New headings

These headings contain content not covered previously.

*   **Dates and spans** – ‘Use en dashes for particular types of year spans’ (H2), ‘Use words for spans of days and months in body text’ (H2) and ‘Use en dashes for spans of days and months when space is limited’ (H2)
*   **UTC** – ‘Coordinated Universal Time’ (H3)
*   **Time and spans** – ‘Use en dashes for spans of time when space is limited’ (H2) and ‘Follow the manual’s number rules for duration’ (H2)
*   **Dates and times together** – ‘How to combine dates and times’ (H2) and ‘Combining dates and times when space is limited’ (H3)
*   **Shortened forms for time units** – ‘Use shortened forms for units of time when space is limited’ (H2)
*   **Standards for dates and time** – ‘Meet standards for data systems and information interchange’ (H2) and associated H3s:
    *   ‘Standards are voluntary’
    *   ‘Basic and extended formats’
    *   ‘Calendar date’
    *   ‘Local time of day’
    *   ‘Ordinal date’ (revision)
