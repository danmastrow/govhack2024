Colons
======

Colons draw attention to the text that follows. Only add colons that are essential. Use them to introduce examples, contrasts, lists and block quotes.

Limit colon use
---------------

Use a colon only if you are sure it is needed. Incorrect use creates confusion for users.

Introduce examples and contrasts with colons
--------------------------------------------

Use a colon to:

*   introduce a word, phrase or clause that provides more detail
*   introduce a question
*   give an example
*   summarise or contrast with what comes before it.

### Example

*   Use correct spelling: check a dictionary if you need to.
*   Our work is about answering this simple question: how?
*   We’ll have to use a stronger tool: sanctions.
*   This is the guiding principle for our workplace: collaboration.
*   The committee found there was only one possible explanation: fraud.

A sentence fragment can come before the colon if the fragment can stand alone or if it’s introducing a bulleted list.

### Example

Warning: strong winds forecast for Sydney today.

Start lists with a colon
------------------------

Use a colon to introduce a list of words, phrases or clauses.

### Example

Pick any 2 of the 3: low price, high speed, high quality.

The position has these requirements: strong communication skills and experience across content management platforms.

We need to:

*   check Appendix A of the report
*   ask Mary about the final chapter of her book
*   rewrite our introduction.

Don’t include a colon when the list flows on as part of a full sentence. This is a common error.

### Correct

Pick any 2 of low price, high speed and high quality.

The requirements for the position are strong communication skills and experience across content management platforms.

### Incorrect

Pick any 2 of: low price, high speed and high quality.

The requirements for the position are: strong communication skills and experience across content management platforms.

Include the colon to restructure content into [bulleted lists](/node/56).

### Example

The requirements for the position are:

*   strong communication skills
*   experience across content management platforms.

Use lower case following a colon in most cases
----------------------------------------------

Start the word after the colon with a lower case letter unless:

*   the word that follows the colon is a [proper noun](/node/122#proper_nouns_are_the_names_of_specific_things)
*   the text after the colon is a question that is a complete sentence.

### Correct

We had to write 66 reports: it took months.

The commander was confident: Special Air Service Regiment had enough ammunition.

### Incorrect

We had to write many reports: It took months.

The commander was confident: special air service regiment had enough ammunition.

After a colon, capitalise the first word of questions that are complete sentences. This makes it clear that the question mark applies only to the text after the colon.

### Like this

The election was fought on a simple question: Which party had the best economic credentials?

### Not this

The election was fought on a simple question: which party had the best economic credentials?

If the colon introduces a series of sentences or questions, use a lead-in and colon to introduce them in a [bulleted or numbered list](/node/56).

### Example

They answered the question:

*   They wrote 23 reports.
*   Each report took 11 days to write.

Start subtitles of books and articles with a colon
--------------------------------------------------

Use a colon before the subtitle of a book or article. Follow the colon with a lower case letter, unless it’s a proper noun.

### Example

_Teaching in Australia: a deep dive into the education system_

Stanovich KE (1986) ‘Matthew effects in reading: some consequences of individual differences in the acquisition of literacy’, _Reading Research Quarterly_, 21(4):360–407.

Do this when writing about a book or article and also when [referencing one](/node/181).

Introduce block quotes with colons
----------------------------------

Use a colon to introduce a block quote. Block quotes should also be coded with the HTML <blockquote>  element.

### Example

For example, Manthorpe (2019) stated:

> Short sentences are easier to read because they limit the scope of an idea. But most readers like the variety and rhythm of a mixture of sentence lengths. For most readers, aim for an average sentence length of 15 words per sentence.

Write mathematical ratios with a colon
--------------------------------------

Use a colon to give a [mathematical ratio](/node/145). Don’t put a space after the colon.

### Example

The government proposes a 50:50 split.

The cost-benefit ratio will be 7.5:1.

Release notes
-------------

The digital edition consolidates information about colons that appeared in different parts of the sixth edition.

The digital edition excludes advice about colons in multi-level lists as it does not recommend using them in the digital environment.

The digital edition recommends [using a colon for a precise reference to time](/node/140#use_numbers_for_the_time_of_day_when_you_need_to_be_precise). The use of a colon as the separator reflects a shift in contemporary Australian usage. Sources cited as evidence on that topic support this change.

The Content Guide had advice about colons in relation to lists only.
