Referencing and attribution
===========================

Reference correctly so users can identify the sources you use.

*   [Author–date](/referencing-and-attribution/author-date)
    -------------------------------------------------------
    
    The author–date system includes details for author and date in the text with a full citation in a list of references. This system is suitable for most Australian Government content.
    
    *   [Broadcast media and podcasts (film, video, television and radio programs)](/referencing-and-attribution/author-date/broadcast-media-and-podcasts-film-video-television-and-radio-programs)
    *   [Classics](/referencing-and-attribution/author-date/classics)
    *   [Musical compositions](/referencing-and-attribution/author-date/musical-compositions)
    *   [Plays and poetry](/referencing-and-attribution/author-date/plays-and-poetry)
    *   [Works of art](/referencing-and-attribution/author-date/works-art)
    
*   [Documentary–note](/referencing-and-attribution/documentary-note)
    -----------------------------------------------------------------
    
    The documentary–note system uses a symbol or number in the text to mark detailed references in footnotes or endnotes. Choose this system only if it best suits the mode of publishing content and user needs.
    
*   [Legal material](/referencing-and-attribution/legal-material)
    -------------------------------------------------------------
    
    There are different conventions for how to cite legal material. Follow one style consistently to help people read and use the information.
    
    *   [Bills and explanatory material](/referencing-and-attribution/legal-material/bills-and-explanatory-material)
    *   [Acts of parliament](/referencing-and-attribution/legal-material/acts-parliament)
    *   [Schedules](/referencing-and-attribution/legal-material/schedules)
    *   [Delegated legislation](/referencing-and-attribution/legal-material/delegated-legislation)
    *   [Cases and legal authorities](/referencing-and-attribution/legal-material/cases-and-legal-authorities)
    *   [Treaties](/referencing-and-attribution/legal-material/treaties)
    *   [Authoritative reports](/referencing-and-attribution/legal-material/authoritative-reports)
    
*   [Shortened forms used in referencing](/referencing-and-attribution/shortened-forms-used-referencing)
    ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    
    Shortened forms are used in referencing to help people quickly identify sources. Unlike other shortened forms, some Latin shortened forms retain full stops.
