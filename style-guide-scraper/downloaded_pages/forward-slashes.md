Forward slashes
===============

Forward slashes are useful in a small number of situations. Users are familiar with them in mathematical expressions, dates, web addresses and in some shortened forms.

Limit the forward slash to specific uses
----------------------------------------

The forward slash is also known as the ‘solidus’ or just the ‘slash’.

Use forward slashes:

*   in some shortened forms
*   in mathematical expressions
*   to present lines of poetry in body text
*   instead of ‘per’, ‘an’ or ‘a’ when abbreviating units of measurement
*   in web addresses
*   in dates if you can’t write them out – for example, in tables
*   in some place names.

### Example

*   c/\- \[for ‘care of’ in postal addresses\]
*   n/a \[for ‘not applicable’\]
*   (x + y)/(a + b)
*   http://www.abc.net.au/foreign
*   04/12/2020

Don’t add spaces around most forward slashes
--------------------------------------------

There is no need to include a space on either side of a forward slash.

The exceptions are for:

*   [official dual place names](/node/134#check_official_place_names_and_style_them_correctly)
*   lines of poetry in body text – use forward slashes with spaces around them to show the line breaks.

### Example

truwana / Cape Barren Island \[Official dual place name\]

### Print considerations

As far as possible, avoid using forward slashes either side of a line break.

If you must, include the slash before the line break so that the reader anticipates it as they read the next line.

Write shortened units of measurement with a forward slash
---------------------------------------------------------

Don’t use forward slashes when spelling out [units of measurement](/node/147).

### Correct

*   60 km/h
*   60 kilometres per hour

### Incorrect

60 kilometres/hour

Use an en dash for financial years, not a slash
-----------------------------------------------

Don’t use a forward slash as a replacement for an en dash in financial years.

### Correct

2019–20

### Incorrect

2019/20

Write ‘or’ instead of a slash for alternatives
----------------------------------------------

When showing alternatives, use ‘or’ instead of a forward slash. This is easier for people to understand.

### Write this

a yes or no question

### Not this

a yes/no question

Do not use ‘and/or’ in text. It could mean either ‘and’ or ‘or’, which confuses many users. Rewrite the sentence to make the meaning clear.

Don’t join words with a slash
-----------------------------

Don’t use a forward slash between words that retain their separate identities. Instead, either use an en dash or reword the sentence. Forward slashes can make it look like you mean to show an alternative.

### Write this

*   a Sydney–Brisbane flight
*   a Sydney to Brisbane flight

### Not this

a Sydney/Brisbane flight
