Hierarchical structure
======================

A hierarchy sorts content into categories and levels. This structure can give users a picture of how items or topics fit together.

-----------------------------------------

Hierarchies structure content by category. They show how different categories relate to each other, and how they relate to the main idea or theme.

This structure is the basis for the information architecture of many websites. It also suits organisational charts and other visual content that ranks items in a hierarchy of relationships.

To structure content hierarchically:

*   Plan the [headings](/node/51).
*   Decide what information fits under each heading.
*   Plan subheadings.
*   Keep the hierarchy shallow – use no more than 4 heading levels.
*   Check the headings for consistency and logic.

### Accessibility requirements

User needs:

*   I can change the content's presentation without losing information or structure.
*   I can find and navigate the content and determine where I am on the webpage.

Fundamentals:

*   Write clear page titles. The title is the first thing a screen reader user will hear and is the first item to appear in search results.
*   Organise content in a clear order using section headings. Describe the topics or the following section in the headings.
*   Make sure all users can navigate through all content in the intended order, regardless of the technology they're using. Use the same navigation elements across services.
