Author–date
===========

The author–date system includes details for author and date in the text with a full citation in a list of references. This system is suitable for most Australian Government content.

Include author and date in text, and list full details later
------------------------------------------------------------

The author–date system uses:

*   in-text citations with the author’s name and the date of publication
*   an alphabetical reference list with the full information about the source.

People use the information from an in-text citation to find the corresponding reference in the list.

The author–date system is useful when you have many sources to cite. It’s mostly used in scientific writing and government reports, but you can use it for any type of writing. It’s more accessible than the documentary–note system, as there are no superscript numbers or symbols.

The referencing systems used by Harvard and the American Psychological Association (APA) are examples of the author–date system. It’s also called the name–year system.

### Copyright requirements

You must properly attribute copyright material you cite or reference. This includes text, images, video and sounds.

Include all the details required by open access licences (read how to [attribute Creative Commons](https://creativecommons.org.au/learn/fact-sheets/attribution/)).

Read the government copyright rules in the [_Australian Government intellectual property manual_](https://www.infrastructure.gov.au/media-centre/publications/australian-government-intellectual-property-manual).

### In-text citations

An in-text citation gives the author’s name and the date of publication. You can put the author’s name as part of a sentence, or it can go in parentheses with the date. Always include the date in parentheses. Don’t separate the name and date with a comma.

#### Example

*   Jones (2017) reported similar results.
*   Other results were similar (Jones 2017).

Most in-text citations have only the author’s family name (or authoring organisation’s name) and the year.

Use the shortened form of an organisation’s name in the in-text citation. (In the reference list, you can use the shortened form followed by the spelt-out form in parentheses.)

#### Example

The ABC (2019) reported ...

#### Two or more authors

For a work by 2 authors, include both names in the in-text citation.

#### Example

Black and Jones (2017) reported similar results.

For a work by 3 or more authors, use the first author’s name plus the Latin term ‘et al.’ (meaning ‘and others’). Don’t use italics for ‘et al.’. All authors’ names are included in the reference list.

#### Example

Holmes et al. (2019) reported many changes.

#### Write this

Other researchers reported similar results (Watson et al. 2017).

#### Not this

Other researchers reported similar results (Watson, Black, Jones and Abaza 2017).

Use the word ‘and’ between names outside and inside parentheses. Don’t use the ampersand (‘&’).

#### Like this

Other researchers reported similar results (Black and Jones 2017).

#### Not this

Other researchers reported similar results (Black & Jones 2017).

#### Page numbers

Include page numbers in the in-text citation only when the work has page numbers and you’re including a direct quotation. Use a colon between the date and page numbers.

##### Example

*   ‘These were identical results’ (White and Jones 2019:23–24).
*   White and Jones (2019:23–24) claimed that these were ‘identical results’.

#### Multiple works in one citation

When citing multiple works in the same in-text citation, use semicolons between citations. Enclose all the citations in one set of parentheses.

##### Example

Other researchers reported similar results (White and Jones 2017; Black 2018; Abaza 2019).

#### Multiple works by the same author in the same year

When citing multiple works by the same author in the same year, put a letter after the date of each citation. Put an ‘a’ after the date of the first work you cite, then a ‘b’ after the date of the second, and so on.

##### Example

She has written extensively on Australia – New Zealand relations (Dobell 2018a, 2018b).

#### Shortened forms and abbreviations of names

Use shortened forms and abbreviations in in-text citations to save space.

Use the same shortened form in the reference list, followed by the spelt-out version. That way the user can easily find the reference but can also see the organisation’s full name.

##### Write this

Australian trade with India expanded significantly in the second half of the decade (DFAT 2018).

##### Not this

Australian trade with India expanded significantly in the second half of the decade (Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade 2018).

#### No date of publication

For works without a date, write ‘n.d.’ (for ‘no date’) instead of the year of publication.

##### Example

*   White and Jones (n.d.) reported similar results.
*   Other researchers reported similar results (White and Jones n.d.).

### Reference lists

A reference list includes the full details of every cited work. Use the heading ‘References’.

On a webpage, place the reference list immediately after the content and under the heading ‘References’. In print, place the reference list after any appendices but before an index.

If the content has sections written by different authors or on different subjects, include a reference list at the end of each section. This helps users who are interested in only one section and keeps reference lists manageable.

Include a reference in your list for each source you cite in text. All other sources can go in a list called ‘More reading’ or ‘More information’. This list should appear after the reference list.

Some types of specialised sources, such as works of art, need their own reference list. Others, like legislation, are only included in a reference list if there are references to other types of works as well.

Check each type of specialised source that you’re using to see if you need to include it in a reference list.

Order the elements of each item in a reference list
---------------------------------------------------

References in the list will have different elements depending on the type of source. For example, when citing a book, include the name of the publisher. When citing a website, include the date you accessed it.

The general order is:

1.  author or authoring organisation’s name
2.  publishing date
3.  title (and series or issue details)
4.  publisher details
5.  accessed date (for digital content).

Some elements have shortened forms used in referencing. Use the shortened form when appropriate.

Follow the examples of author–date citations.

### Personal author names

Write the family name of the authors, editors or translators before writing their initials. Use the original spelling for all author names.

Don’t separate the family name from the initials with a comma. Don’t separate initials with full stops.

#### Like this

Smith AB

#### Not this

*   Smith, AB
*   Smith A.B.

### Works by 2 or more authors

Unlike for in-text citations, include all of the authors’ names in a reference list.

#### Write this

Jackson D, Li X and Chandran P (2018) ‘Safety and equity’, _Psychological Science Australia_, 2(4):223–240.

#### Not this

Jackson D et al. (2018) ‘Safety and equity’, _Psychological Science Australia_, 2(4):223–240.

### Government names that have changed

Organisations change names over time. Use the name that appears on the source.

For example, the Services Australia annual report for 2016–17 has the author as the Department of Human Services. That was the name of the agency at the time, so use Department of Human Services as the author when you cite the report.

### Shortened forms and abbreviations of organisations’ names

If you have used the shortened form of an organisation’s name in your content, use it in your references. Use the shortened form followed by the spelt-out version in parentheses.

Use the shortened form in subsequent references.

#### Example

DFAT (Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade) (2018) [_Fact sheets for countries and regions – India_](https://www.dfat.gov.au/trade/resources/trade-and-economic-fact-sheets-for-countries-economies-and-regions), DFAT, accessed 9 July 2021.

Only use a shortened form of an agency’s name if the agency uses it regularly.

For example, the Australian Public Service Commission regularly uses the initialism ‘APSC’, so use it after the first mention and in the references.

Often, an organisation's name is both the author of the webpage and the name of the website. To avoid repetition of long names, use the shortened form for the name of the website after the title. Do this even if you have not introduced the shortened form before.

#### Like this

Australian and New Zealand Spatial Information Council (n.d.) [_Place names_](https://www.anzlic.gov.au/resources/foundation-spatial-data-framework/fsdf-themes-datasets/place-names), ANZLIC website, accessed 5 December 2019.

#### Not this

Australian and New Zealand Spatial Information Council (n.d.) [_Place names_](https://www.anzlic.gov.au/resources/foundation-spatial-data-framework/fsdf-themes-datasets/place-names), Australian and New Zealand Spatial Information Council website, accessed 5 December 2019.

### Works without a date

For works without a date, write ‘n.d.’ instead of the date of publication.

#### Example

*   Lists should be clear (McMurrey n.d.) … \[In-text citation\]
*   McMurrey DA (n.d.) [_Online technical writing: lists_](https://mcmassociates.io/textbook/lists.html), mcmassociates.io, accessed 30 September 2022. \[Reference list item\]

### Works that need the full date of publication

For works like newspaper articles and social media posts, include the full date – not just the year – in the reference list. It makes it easier for users to find this detail.

#### Write this

Richardson A (24 May 2018) ‘[Australia imports almost all of its oil, and there are pitfalls all over the globe](https://theconversation.com/australia-imports-almost-all-of-its-oil-and-there-are-pitfalls-all-over-the-globe-97070)’, _The Conversation_, accessed 29 January 2020.

#### Not this

Richardson A (2018) ‘[Australia imports almost all of its oil, and there are pitfalls all over the globe](https://theconversation.com/australia-imports-almost-all-of-its-oil-and-there-are-pitfalls-all-over-the-globe-97070)’, _The Conversation_, accessed 29 January 2020.

Style and spell titles consistently
-----------------------------------

Use capitals, punctuation and italics consistently in all references.

Follow the rules in the examples of author–date citations, but generally:

*   Capitalise all proper nouns, the names of periodicals and the first word of titles.
*   Use lower case for all other words.
*   Use commas to separate elements after the title.
*   Use a full stop at the end of the reference.

Use italics for the [formal title of a complete published work](/node/187).

Don't use italics if the reference is:

*   a book chapter
*   an article
*   a poem
*   an episode
*   a page that is part of a series or a similar division.

If it’s part of a publication, use single quotation marks around the title and use italics for the name of the series, book or periodical.

### Example

*   Mackenzie J (2011) _The editor’s companion_, 2nd edn, Cambridge University Press, Melbourne. \[The italicised title is for a complete published work.\]
*   Yik J (1 June 2017) ‘[Changing Australian medicine names](https://www.nps.org.au/australian-prescriber/articles/changing-australian-medicine-names)’, _Australian Prescriber_, accessed 5 December 2019. \[The reference is to a title for part of a publication (a periodical).\]

Use the original spelling for all titles and periodical names. This includes retaining misspellings and American spelling variations.

### Example

Bishop S and Back F (2020) ‘Organizational issues and color-coding’, _Journal of Pediatric Science_, 4(2):22–25. \[‘Organizational’ is an American spelling.\]

Hyperlink titles and include access dates for online works
----------------------------------------------------------

Unless the source is behind a paywall, hyperlink the title of works available online.

You don’t need to include the URL in references in digital content.

### Example

DFAT (Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade) (2018) [_Fact sheets for countries and regions – India_](https://www.dfat.gov.au/trade/resources/trade-and-economic-fact-sheets-for-countries-economies-and-regions), DFAT, accessed 9 July 2021.

Content publishers should make sure the [CSS print style sheet](https://www.w3.org/standards/webdesign/htmlcss) automatically displays the URLs from the hyperlinks when the content is printed. This might be a default style in your document’s template.

If the document is print only, include a URL after the reference. Put the URL after the final full stop.

### Example

DFAT (Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade) (2018) _Fact sheets for countries and regions – India_, DFAT, accessed 9 July 2021. https://www.dfat.gov.au/trade/resources/trade-and-economic-fact-sheets-for-countries-economies-and-regions

\[A print-only reference: the full hyperlink comes after the full stop, as the title cannot be hyperlinked.\]

Include the date you accessed the work. This is important because online sources can change. The information you’re linking to could be different to what users will find in the future.

### PDFs

If you’re citing a PDF, avoid linking directly to the PDF. Instead link to the landing page where the PDF is hosted.

Landing pages tend to be a more stable place to link to. PDFs are often renamed or moved around a site. Linking to a PDF also requires the user to download content.

#### Example

Thomson Reuters Australia (2017) ‘[Legislation and commentary table of abbreviations](https://support.thomsonreuters.com.au/product/westlaw-au/articles/westlaw-au-guide-legislation-and-commentary-table-abbreviations)’ Westlaw AU Guides, Thomson Reuters Australia, accessed 6 April 2020.

\[The link targets a landing page, not a PDF.\]

If the PDF doesn’t have a landing page, link to the PDF and include ‘PDF’ in square brackets after the title. Follow ‘PDF’ with the file size in kilobytes (KB) or megabytes (MB). Include both of these additional details in the linked text.

Cite the PDF with the details you can find in the document. Sometimes details like publication dates will be missing.

#### Example

Thomson Reuters Australia (n.d.) [_Table of abbreviations_ \[PDF 94.35 KB\]](https://support.thomsonreuters.com.au/sites/default/files/2017-09/AU-WLAU-Guide-Leg-Com-Table-of-Abbreviations.PDF), Thomson Reuters Australia, accessed 20 January 2020.

### Digital object identifiers (DOIs)

A DOI is a series of numbers and punctuation that identifies a document. Unlike a URL, a DOI always stays the same. [DOIs are also internationally standardised](https://www.doi.org/index.html).

Works that have DOIs include most journal articles, some e-books and some PDFs.

If the document has a DOI, include it in the citation in the reference list. Put it at the end of the citation and include the shortened form ‘doi’ in lower case before it.

#### Example

Kelleher T (2009) ‘Conversational voice’, _Journal of Communication_, 59(1):172–188, doi:10.1111/j.1460-2466.2008.01410.x.

Detail page, volume and issue numbers
-------------------------------------

If a citation has a volume number, an issue number and page numbers, follow the format: volume(issue):page–page.

### Example

Jackson D, Li X and Chandran P (2018) ‘Safety and equity’, _Psychological Science Australia_, 2(4):223–240.

In this example, the work is from volume 2, issue 4, and it’s on pages 223 to 240.

Alphabetise the reference items in the list
-------------------------------------------

Order the reference list in alphabetical order, according to the family name and given name of the lead author.

### Example

*   Jackson D, Li X and Chandran P (2018) ‘Safety and equity’, _Psychological Science Australia_, 2(4):223–240.
*   Richardson A (24 May 2018) ‘[Australia imports almost all of its oil, and there are pitfalls all over the globe](https://theconversation.com/australia-imports-almost-all-of-its-oil-and-there-are-pitfalls-all-over-the-globe-97070)’, _The Conversation_, accessed 29 January 2020.

### Multiple works by the same author

If you have multiple works by the same writer, list them in date order.

#### Example

Schade S (1 February 2015) ‘[The fold manifesto: why the page fold still matters](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/page-fold-manifesto/)’, _Nielsen Norman Group_, accessed 12 November 2019.

Schade S (11 February 2018) ‘[Inverted pyramid: writing for comprehension](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/inverted-pyramid/)’, _Nielsen Norman Group_, accessed 12 November 2019.

In very long reference lists, such as in reports and theses, the same author may be cited many times.

To avoid repetition, you can use 2 unspaced em dashes for works by the same author cited immediately afterwards.

#### Example

ABS (Australian Bureau of Statistics) (2014a) [_Arts and culture in Australia: a statistical overview_](https://www.abs.gov.au/AUSSTATS/abs@.nsf/productsbyCatalogue/8EB0AA3F1775AC35CA257B02000ECD50?OpenDocument), ABS website, accessed 20 July 2019.

### Multiple works by the same author in the same year

When citing multiple works by the same author in the same year, put a letter after the date of each citation. Put an ‘a’ after the date of the first work you cite and a ‘b’ after the date of the second one, and so on.

Include both works in the reference list.

#### Example

Dobell G (30 April 2018a) ‘[Big chill between China and Australia](https://www.aspistrategist.org.au/big-chill-china-australia/)’, _The Strategist_, accessed 23 February 2020.

Dobell G (30 April 2018b) ‘[Cold winds of the fifth China–Oz icy age](https://www.aspistrategist.org.au/cold-winds-fifth-china-oz-icy-age/)’, _The Strategist_, accessed 24 February 2020.

If a writer has been the sole author for some references and the lead author for others, list the works in order of:

*   the alphabetical order of the secondary authors
*   the date of publication.

#### Example

*   Adams A (n.d.)
*   Adams A (2019a) …
*   Adams A (2019b) …
*   Adams A, Brown B and Zinger Z (2009) …
*   Adams B (2017) …
*   Adams B and Black B (2011) …
*   Adams B and Zinger Z (2010) …
*   Adams W, Zinger Z, Black B and Brown B (2013a) …
*   Adams W, Zinger Z, Black B and Brown B (2013b) …

### Reports

For reports published online, hyperlink the title of the report and include an accessed date. If you’re citing a PDF, avoid linking directly to the PDF. Instead link to the page that hosts the PDF.

Sources with title pages will detail the author and publisher. Follow the authoring details on the title page of the document.

#### Report by an Australian government agency

Rule: Author A or Agency Name (Year) _Title of report: subtitle of report_, Name of Agency, Name of Government, accessed Day Month Year.

In the reference list, use the short title followed by a spaced en dash and the full source information. List the source where the first word of the short title would be alphabetically.

##### Example

The Gonski report (2011) suggests that ... \[In-text citation\]

Gonski report _–_ Gonski D, Boston K, Greiner K, Lawrence, C, Scales B and Tannock P (2011) _Review of funding for schooling: final report_, Department of Education, Employment and Workplace Relations, Australian Government, accessed 11 February 2020. \[Reference list entry\]

### Parliamentary sources

Parliamentary papers, such as budget papers, white papers and annual reports, are published:

*   as individual documents
*   as bound volumes of all documents tabled in a parliamentary sitting.

For individual documents, cite them as you would any document of that type. For example, if you access an annual report on a departmental website, cite it as a government report.

#### Bound parliamentary papers

For documents you access as part of a bound volume from a parliamentary sitting:

*   use the name of the parliament as the author
*   include the paper number.

Rule: Name of Parliament (Year) _Title of document: subtitle of document_, Parl Paper X, Name of Government.

##### Example

Parliament of Australia (2000) _Department of Finance and Administration annual report 1999–2000_, Parl Paper 32, Australian Government.

#### Parliamentary debates and proceedings

To cite a record of what was said in parliament verbatim, as recorded in Hansard, use the volume and page number. Volume numbers are before the colon, page numbers are after.

Rule: Name of Parliamentary Committee or House (Year) _Debates_, volume:page–page.

##### Example

*   Australian Senate (2000) _Debates_, S25:65.

### Data sets

For online data sets, hyperlink the title and include the accessed date. If you’re citing a PDF or spreadsheet, avoid linking directly to the document. Instead link to the webpage that hosts the document.

Rule: Author A (Year) _Title of data set_ \[data set\], Name of Website website, accessed Day Month Year.

#### Example

National Native Title Tribunal (2014) [_Native Title determination outcomes_](https://data.gov.au/data/dataset/native-title-determination-outcomes) \[data set\], data.gov.au, accessed 4 January 2020.

The Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) has a [guide to referencing ABS material](https://www.abs.gov.au/how-cite-abs-sources).

Follow the ABS advice for information to include, but adjust capitalisation and punctuation to be in line with the rest of the reference list for your content.

#### Example

Australian Bureau of Statistics (2016) [_2016 Census – Cultural Diversity_](https://guest.censusdata.abs.gov.au/webapi/jsf/dataCatalogueExplorer.xhtml) \[TableBuilder\], accessed 16 November 2020. \[ABS format\]

ABS (Australian Bureau of Statistics) (2016) [_2016 Census – Cultural diversity_](https://guest.censusdata.abs.gov.au/webapi/jsf/dataCatalogueExplorer.xhtml) \[TableBuilder\], ABS website, accessed 16 November 2020. \[Author–date format\]

### Records from the National Archives of Australia

The National Archives of Australia (NAA) has a [guide to referencing records it holds](https://www.naa.gov.au/help-your-research/using-collection/citing-archival-records). Follow this advice exactly, but add a full stop at the end of the citation.

#### Example

National Archives of Australia: Prime Minister’s Department; A461, Correspondence files, multiple number series (third system), 1934–50; AX314/1/1, Aeronautical Research in the British Empire, 1945–49 \[NAA format\]

National Archives of Australia: Prime Minister’s Department; A461, Correspondence files, multiple number series (third system), 1934–50; AX314/1/1, Aeronautical Research in the British Empire, 1945–49. \[Author–date format\]

Sequence the elements of online sources
---------------------------------------

Only cite an entire website if you cannot pinpoint the material to a specific webpage or webpage content.

For example, you might mention a website as a general resource in the body text. You would give users the full details and link to that website in the reference list.

However, if you refer to content only found on a particular webpage on the website, you need to pinpoint the relevant webpage or webpage content in the reference list.

### Entire website

Hyperlink the name of the website. 

Always include the date you accessed the site at the end of the reference.

Use the same capitalisation as the organisation uses for the name of a website.

Include the word ‘website’ after the name of the website in square brackets, unless you include the URL for the homepage.

It is optional to include the URL for the homepage – for example ‘stylemanual.gov.au’. If you include the homepage URL, do not include the word ‘website’ in square brackets.

Rule: Author A (Year) _Name of website_, URL \[optional\], accessed Day Month Year.

#### Example

*   APSC (Australian Public Service Commission) (2021) [_Australian Government Style Manual_](/node/15), stylemanual.gov.au, accessed 3 October 2021.
*   eSafety Commissioner (n.d.) [_eSafety_](https://www.esafety.gov.au/) \[website\], accessed 3 December 2020. 

### Webpages and webpage content

Hyperlink the title of the webpage. Don’t link to PDFs or other downloadable documents. Instead link to the page that hosts the document.

Always include the date you accessed the site at the end of the reference.

Use the same capitalisation as the organisation uses for the name of a website.

Include the word ‘website’ after the name of the website, unless the name of the website is a URL, for example WA.gov.au.

#### Webpage with authors listed

Rule: Author A (Year) _Title of webpage_, Name of Website website, accessed Day Month Year.

##### Example

Clement J (2020) [_Device usage of Facebook users worldwide as of July 2020_](https://www.statista.com/statistics/377808/distribution-of-facebook-users-by-device/), Statista website, accessed 16 September 2020.

#### Webpage written by an organisation

Rule: Organisation Name or Abbreviation (Year) _Title of webpage_, Name of Website website, accessed Day Month Year.

##### Example

Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet (n.d.) [_Australian National Anthem_](https://www.pmc.gov.au/government/australian-national-anthem), PM&C website, accessed 20 January 2020.

#### Webpage as part of a larger publication or series
