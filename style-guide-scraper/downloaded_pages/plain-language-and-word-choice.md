Plain language and word choice
==============================

Plain language can express complex ideas. Engage people with words they can understand quickly: use the list on this page. Clarify expressions people might be unfamiliar with.

Use everyday words
------------------

Choose words that people are familiar with. Unfamiliar words make content harder to read and understand.

### Accessibility requirements

User need:

I can read and understand text, even if the content includes unusual words and shortened forms, or features languages other than English.

Fundamentals:

*   Write in plain language. This helps all users and is essential for some.
*   Avoid (or explain) unusual words, phrases, idioms and so on. Expand all acronyms on their first use.
*   Avoid using double negatives.

Web Content Accessibility Guidelines success criteria:

*   [3.1.5 Reading level](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/quickref/#reading-level) [–](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/quickref/#unusual-words) [level AAA](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/quickref/#reading-level). Level AAA requires a lower secondary education reading level, after removal of proper names and titles, ([year 7 or between 12 and 14 years old](https://www.stylemanual.gov.au/node/62#literacy_affects_access_to_government_services_and_information))
*   [3.1.3 Unusual words – level AAA](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/quickref/#unusual-words)
*   [3.1.4 Abbreviations – level AAA](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/quickref/#abbreviations)

### Use ‘we’, ‘you’ and ‘us’ if you can

Use personal pronouns (like ‘we’, ‘you’, ‘us’) when it suits the voice and tone.

A direct, active [voice and tone helps to engage users](/node/40). Active voice and tone makes it clear who must do what.

#### Like this

We will assess your application within 30 days. \[Active voice makes who is doing what clear. Personal pronouns ‘we’ and ‘your’ support a direct tone.\]

#### Not this

Applications are assessed within 30 days. \[Passive voice makes who is doing what less clear. There are no pronouns in this sentence.\]

### Avoid jargon

Remove jargon, slang and idioms.

#### Like this

They changed their decision in response to new information.

#### Not this

They changed their decision in light of new information. \[‘In light of’ is an idiom.\]

### Use inclusive language

People can relate to content when it uses [inclusive language](/node/178). Choose words that respect all people, including their rights and their heritage.

Learn about the words people use
--------------------------------

Find out if your word choice matches the words people will use to find the content. What is obvious to you might not be obvious to them.

Including the everyday words and phrases you discover also helps people understand your content. People engage more readily with familiar language.

You can build insight through [user research and content testing](/node/76). For example, you can check whether:

*   you are using unfamiliar jargon
*   you need to highlight unfamiliar concepts and explain them.

Check search engine analytics for terms people are using to find related content online. You can discover useful search terms and [keywords to include in search engine optimisation](/node/72).

Choose simple words, not complicated expressions
------------------------------------------------

There is usually more than one way to express something. Find the simplest, clearest option.

Replace longer words and phrases with simpler alternatives. You can use this table as a starting point.

Keep words and phrases with special meaning to a minimum
--------------------------------------------------------

People can be unfamiliar with words you need to use, for example:

*   [official titles](/node/149)
*   [Acts of parliament](/node/208)
*   [names of organisations](/node/88).

For names and terms with special meaning, follow [style rules and conventions](/node/117). This helps users scan content.

Be selective about shortened forms, such as [abbreviations](/node/184), [contractions](https://www.stylemanual.gov.au/grammar-punctuation-and-conventions/shortened-words-and-phrases/contractions), [acronyms and initialisms](/node/190).

Some shortened forms are better-known than the full form of the term, for example ‘DNA’. Check a dictionary to see if the acronym or initialism is listed.

Shorten only the words and phrases that are well known or used many times in your content. Shortened forms can help people read and understand content, but too many can be difficult to keep track of.

Spell them out the first time you use them.

### Example

The Digital Transformation Agency (DTA) helps government agencies create digital services.

Shortened forms can be a type of jargon that is not suitable in plain language content. Try to avoid them altogether if they are used only once or twice.

You can include technical or specialist terms if your research shows your audience uses them. But start with plain language words as the default to keep the reading level accessible. [Plain language helps everyone](/node/62#simple_content_helps_all_users).

To help people understand specialist or technical content:

*   explain terms – for example, use a glossary
*   include a short summary without using specialist terms.

In content with many specialist terms, reserve shortened forms for the most frequently used terms only. Spell out other terms in full.
