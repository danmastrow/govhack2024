Natural phenomena
=================

Treat terms for climate and weather events with consistent style. It helps users scan content for keywords and supports readability.  

Standard rules of capitalisation apply for most natural phenomena
-----------------------------------------------------------------

Follow the rules of capitalisation for most natural phenomena:

*   Proper nouns start with a capital letter.
*   Adjectives and common nouns are in lower case.

Do not use italics.

Most terms are usually in lower case
------------------------------------

Write generic terms for climate and weather in lower case. This rule applies to many compound nouns.

### Example

climate change, global warming, greenhouse gases

Specific terms usually take lower case. For example, this rule applies to scientific names for types of clouds.

### Example

cumulonimbus, cirrus and stratus

Terms for specific phenomena can take initial capitals
------------------------------------------------------

Scientific terms for natural phenomena can include common nouns that combine to form a proper noun.

Use initial capitals when spelling out this kind of scientific term. Common shortened forms are in full capitals. Any non-English names retain the spelling of the original.

### Example

*   Indian Ocean Dipole (IOD)
*   Southern Oscillation Index (SOI)

Climate and weather events take on proper names
-----------------------------------------------

Individual climate and weather events have names to help communicate the event to the public.

There are specific capitalisation rules for climate and weather events. We follow the style recommended by Australia’s Bureau of Meteorology.

For events not listed here, follow the standard rules for capitalisation.

### Cyclones are usually given people’s names

Use initial capitals for the names of cyclones.

Do this for the given name and for the adjectives and common nouns that appear immediately before the given name. The bureau uses ‘Cyclone’, ‘Tropical Cyclone’ and ‘Severe Tropical Cyclone’ as part of the cyclone’s name.

Check the name is accurate on the [bureau’s website](http://www.bom.gov.au/).

Use the same rule for hurricanes and typhoons. These are different terms for the same natural phenomenon.

#### Example

*   Cyclone Yasi
*   Tropical Cyclone Winifred
*   Severe Tropical Cyclone Damien
*   Hurricane Wilma
*   Typhoon Fengshen

Always write ‘Cyclone’ as part of the name unless it is clear from the surrounding text that you are referring to a cyclone.

#### Example

Hilda was the first cyclone in the Australian region to make landfall in the 2017–18 season.

Cyclone Hilda made landfall in the 2017–18 season.

### Droughts are usually named after a period in time

If the time is a formal period, the name has an initial capital.

#### Example

*   Millennium drought
*   Federation drought
*   the 1982–83 major drought

### Fires are usually named for a time or location

Bushfires take initial capitals for the adjectival part of their name as well as any proper noun. Fires leading to substantial loss of life and property are usually named after the worst day or where they started.

#### Example

*   State Mine fire (New South Wales, 2013)
*   Black Saturday bushfires (Victoria, 2009)
*   Ash Wednesday bushfires (Victoria and South Australia, 1983)
*   Black Tuesday bushfires (Tasmania, 1967)
*   Black Friday bushfires (Victoria and New South Wales, 1939)
*   Black Thursday bushfires (Victoria, 1851)

During a fire, authorities usually name a fire based on where it started.

#### Example

the Taylors Creek Road fire

### Floods, earthquakes and tsunamis are named by year, location and event

Use ‘year Location event’ as the naming convention for floods, earthquakes and tsunamis. Only the location (the proper noun) has an initial capital.

#### Example

*   1974 Brisbane flood
*   1989 Newcastle earthquake
*   2004 Indian Ocean tsunami
