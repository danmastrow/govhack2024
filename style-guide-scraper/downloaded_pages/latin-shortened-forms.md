Latin shortened forms
=====================

Use English rather than Latin shortened forms, except in some cases. People will prefer the English equivalent unless the context requires special use.

Avoid using Latin shortened forms in most content
-------------------------------------------------

Use Latin forms only in limited situations – for example:

*   where there’s limited space, such as in tables
*   in technical and specialist publications that use them.

Unlike other shortened forms, some Latin shortened forms have full stops.

The terms ‘i.e.’ and ‘e.g.’ need full stops after each letter. This helps screen readers announce them.

Don’t follow ‘e.g.’ or ‘i.e.’ with a comma, regardless of whether you would use a comma in the sentence.

Use the English words where possible
------------------------------------

Rather than using ‘e.g.’ or ‘i.e.’ write the English words out in full. Write ‘for example’ and ‘that is’ instead, particularly in more formal publications.

### Like this

*   They found some aspects of grammar confusing – for example, the different types of pronouns.
*   The department has a major problem with its website – that is, users find pages are very slow to load.

### Not this

*   They found some aspects of grammar confusing, e.g. the different types of pronouns.
*   The department has a major problem with its website, i.e. users find pages very slow to load.

Don’t use the shortened form for _et cetera_. Use of ‘etc.’ is redundant in a list introduced by ‘for example’, ‘such as’ or ‘including’. These expressions show that the list is incomplete.

If you think you need to include ‘etc.’ because there’s more to say, include these ideas in your sentence instead.

*   This funding is for upgrading roads in the Gold Coast and Hinterland urban centres (Surfers Paradise, Southport, Upper Coomera and Robina). \[All the places are listed, so ‘for example’ isn’t needed.\]

### Incorrect

Release notes
-------------

The digital edition follows the Content Guide’s advice to avoid using Latin shortened forms. It lists common shortened forms and provides advice on the limited circumstances where they could be used and how to punctuate them. 

This is a departure from advice in the sixth edition, which listed ‘thoroughly anglicised’ shortened forms used regularly in publications. It did not explicitly warn against their use. The sixth edition recommended against using ‘i.e.’, ‘e.g.’ and ‘etc.’ in body text and in formal content.

The digital edition updates punctuation style for shortened forms. 

*   It removes the requirement to use full stops with [non-Latin abbreviations](/node/184).
*   Consistent with the sixth edition, it does not use full stops with [acronyms or initialisms](/node/190), or [contractions](/node/191).

The digital edition changes the recommendation to use a full stop with the contraction ‘no’ for the word ‘number’ (from the Latin, _numero_). This aligns the guidance with the general rule for shortened forms, and with the principle of minimal punctuation.
