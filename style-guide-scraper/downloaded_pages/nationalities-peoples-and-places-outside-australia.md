Nationalities, peoples and places outside Australia
===================================================

Refer to peoples and places outside Australia based on current information. Correct spelling and style avoids causing confusion or offence among users.  

Check official sources for country and place names
--------------------------------------------------

Some countries have several official names. Consult trusted references to decide which name to use, then use it consistently. Helpful references include:

*   the [countries, economies and regions](https://www.dfat.gov.au/geo/pages/countries-and-regions) webpages, on the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade website
*   the United Nations [geographical names database](https://unstats.un.org/unsd/geoinfo/geonames/)
*   the Australian Bureau of Statistics _[Standard Australian classification of countries](https://www.abs.gov.au/AUSSTATS/abs@.nsf/Lookup/1269.0Main+Features102016?OpenDocument)_.

### Example

The United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland is often called the ‘United Kingdom’.

The names of countries can change for political reasons. For example, a country might change its name to show independence from a former occupying country.

### Example

The Democratic Republic of the Congo used to be called ‘Zaire’. The former name came from the Portuguese colonial name for the Congo River.

Country boundaries can also change.

Spell country names with a capital letter
-----------------------------------------

Use initial capitals for:

*   the official name of a country
*   any commonly used short forms of the country’s name
*   the names of states, territories and provinces.

The definite article ‘the’ isn’t capitalised unless it begins a sentence.

### Example

*   the Cayman Islands – the Caymans
*   the Falkland Islands – the Falklands

Shorten a country name only if it is clear to the user
------------------------------------------------------

Use a short form of a country’s name only if it’s clear and accurate. Shortened forms can make it easier to read text or tables, illustrations, notes, lists and bibliographies.

### Example

‘North Korea’ is the shortened form of the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea.

Use English versions of countries and places in most content
------------------------------------------------------------

English-language content usually uses the English version of a country’s name.

### Example

*   ‘Socialist Republic of Vietnam’ is the English version of _Cộng hòa xã hội chủ nghĩa Việt Nam_.
*   ‘Germany’ is the English version of _Deutschland_.
*   ‘New Zealand’ is the English version of _Aotearoa_.
*   ‘The Czech Republic’ or ‘Czechia’ are the English versions of _Česká republika_.

There are some cases where the preferred official name isn’t in English.

### Example

*   ‘Côte d’Ivoire’ is the preferred official name for the Ivory Coast.
*   ‘Eswatini’ is the preferred name for Swaziland.

In English-speaking countries, the convention is to use the established English forms for well-known place names.

### Example

*   Beijing
*   Krakow
*   Rome
*   Brussels
*   Florence
*   Pyongyang
*   the Hague

When the name is used generically, you don’t need an initial capital.

### Example

*   brussels sprout \[A type of sprout, not a sprout from Brussels\]
*   venetian blind \[A type of screen for a window, not a blind from Venice\]
*   french door \[A type of door, not a door from France\]

Check the official status for area and region names
---------------------------------------------------

Groups of nations or areas that are recognised as political or geographic regions take initial capitals.

### Example

*   South-East Asia
*   Central America
*   the Balkans

Use lower case if the names of compass points (such as north and south-east) are not part of the name but are used to refer to the geographic area.

### Example

*   southern Germany
*   northern Iraq

Some names that aren’t officially recognised become well known and gain a semi-official status. Use a dictionary to help you decide when this is appropriate.

### Example

Kurdistan

Write nationalities, peoples and places with initial capitals
-------------------------------------------------------------

There’s usually a clear relationship between the name of the country or region and the word used for the nationality. It’s not always obvious though, so check a dictionary to ensure you’re using the correct term.

### Example

*   Türkiye – Turkish
*   Melanesia – Melanesian
*   the Philippines – Filipino
*   Congo – Congolese
*   United Arab Emirates – Emirati
*   New Zealand – New Zealander

Follow guidance for writing non-English [personal names](/node/90).

Capitalise the names of certain groups.

### Example

*   People groups – Hispanic, Sentinelese, Vietnamese Rục, Sámi
*   Clans – Clan Campbell (Scottish)
*   People from particular regions – Asian, European, Sumatran, Basque
*   People who follow particular religions – Jewish, Christian, Muslim, Buddhist, Hindu, Greek Orthodox
*   People who speak particular languages – Hokkien-speaking

Check if an official language differs from the country name
-----------------------------------------------------------

The name of a country’s language isn’t always derived from the name of the country.

### Example

*   The people of Iran speak Farsi.
*   Dari and Pashto are the official languages of Afghanistan.
*   While Chileans speak Spanish, Brazilians speak Portuguese.
*   East Timor has 2 official languages: Portuguese and Tetum.

Release notes
-------------

The digital edition builds on sixth edition content: it consolidates details about peoples and places outside of Australia. It links to authoritative sources so users can find current spelling for official country and place names.

The guidance on nationalities, language names and groups of peoples relates to guidance on:

*   [personal names](/node/90#follow_reliable_sources_for_nonenglish_names)
*   [cultural and linguistic diversity](/node/59).

The Content Guide had generic advice about capitalisation. It did not go into detail about names of people and places outside Australia.
