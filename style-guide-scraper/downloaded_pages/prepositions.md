Prepositions
============

A preposition creates relationships between words or phrases. Some words only work with specific prepositions. Choose them deliberately to convey meaning to users.  
  

A preposition creates relationships between words or phrases
------------------------------------------------------------

Prepositions show a relationship between a [noun](/node/122) or [v](https://dtg.govcms.gov.au/format-writing-and-structure/clear-language-and-expression/words-and-function/pronouns)[erb](/node/128). Use prepositions to give information about the time and place of an action or thing.

Examples of prepositions are:

*   in
*   before
*   around
*   since
*   between.

Prepositions often come before related words or [phrases](/node/144).

### Example

*   Put the book on the table. \['On' shows the position of 'the book' in relation to 'the table'.\]
*   During her time in office, she launched 50 projects. \['During' refers to 'her time'; 'in' refers to 'office'.\]
*   They had many discussions about the restructure. \['About' refers to 'the restructure'.\]

You can use some prepositions as a different type of word, depending on their function in the sentence. For example, 'down' can be a preposition, part of a verb or an adverb.

### Example

*   I walked down the hill. \['Down' is a preposition.\]
*   Prices came down from an all-time high. \['Down' is part of the phrasal verb 'came down'. 'From' is the preposition.\]
*   Please read down to the bottom of the page. \['Down' is an adverb describing the verb 'read'.\]

Some words only work with specific prepositions
-----------------------------------------------

Not all prepositions work for every word or phrase. Some words are always followed by particular prepositions. For example, 'different' is always followed by 'to' or 'from', but not by 'than'. Check a dictionary if you are not sure.

### Correct

### Incorrect

*   This is different than that.
*   The discussion around the program is continuing.
