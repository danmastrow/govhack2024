Structuring content
===================

Design content with a structure that helps the user navigate and understand.

*   [Types of structure](/structuring-content/types-structure)
    ----------------------------------------------------------
    
    Structure supports the user as they search for information. Use the type of structure that suits the content and how people will need to consume it.

    *   [Hierarchical structure](/structuring-content/types-structure/hierarchical-structure)
    *   [Narrative structure](/structuring-content/types-structure/narrative-structure)
    *   [Sequential structure](/structuring-content/types-structure/sequential-structure)
    
*   [Headings](/structuring-content/headings)
    -----------------------------------------
    
    Headings help users scan content and find what they need. Organise content using clear heading levels. Begin each heading with keywords and keep it to the point.
    
*   [Links](/structuring-content/links)
    -----------------------------------
    
    Links can help users navigate content. Include links when they support user journeys and for search engine optimisation. Write link text that is accurate and accessible.
    
*   [Lists](/structuring-content/lists)
    -----------------------------------
    
    Lists make it easy for users to scan and understand a series of items. Structure and style lists with the user in mind. Set up grammatical structure for list items with a lead-in.
    
*   [Paragraphs](/structuring-content/paragraphs)
    ---------------------------------------------
    
    One idea per paragraph helps users absorb information. Organise them under headings to help users scan the content. Write short paragraphs, each with a topic sentence.
    
*   [Tables](/structuring-content/tables)
    -------------------------------------
    
    Tables provide a structure for complex and detailed information. Design accessible tables and organise data so itâ€™s easy for users to scan.
    
*   [Text boxes and callouts](/structuring-content/text-boxes-and-callouts)
    -----------------------------------------------------------------------
    
    Text boxes, pull-quotes and sidebars draw attention from body text. Make sure they are accessible to everyone.
