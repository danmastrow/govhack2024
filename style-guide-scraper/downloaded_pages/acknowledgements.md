The Style Manual is the result of the generosity and passion of all our contributors.

We have been privileged to be able to tap into knowledge from people across government and external organisations.

Subject matter experts gave us invaluable insights through their feedback, and their participation in user research and usability testing. Accredited editors, content designers and accessibility specialists have provided writing, proofreading and expert reviews.

We value all your contributions – big and small. You’ve helped our holistic approach and to bring integrity to the first digital Style Manual.

We’ve done our best to contact everyone involved. We’re sorry if we’ve missed you. If you’d like your details to display below, please contact us at [info@stylemanual.gov.au](mailto:info@stylemanual.gov.au).
