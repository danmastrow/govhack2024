Adverbs
=======

Adverbs modify meaning when they’re added to a sentence. Use them occasionally to show people how, when, where, or the extent to which something happens.  

Adverbs add more information about other types of words
-------------------------------------------------------

Adverbs modify verbs, adjectives and other adverbs. They often, but not always, end in ‘-ly’.

### Example

*   The staff worked happily. \[Modifies the verb ‘worked’\]
*   The staff arrived early this morning. \[Modifies the verb ‘arrived’\]
*   She is a very dedicated worker. \[Modifies the adjective ‘dedicated’\]
*   You finished quite quickly. \[Modifies the adverb ‘quickly’\]

Adverbs can affect clarity
--------------------------

Use adverbs sparingly. Remove any adverb that doesn’t play a critical function in a [sentence](/node/204).

Because adverbs are modifiers, they can affect clarity. A lack of clarity can cause users to lose trust in government content.

Comparison with adverbs is by degree
------------------------------------

Like adjectives, adverbs can have degree to show or imply a comparison. In general, you simply add the word ‘more’ or ‘most’ in front of the adverb.

Depending on the context, some [words can be adjectives or adverbs](/node/203). Make sure you use the correct form. For example, ‘quickest’ is the adjective and ‘most quickly’ is the adverb.

### Example

#### Comparative

Bob spoke more quickly than Tom. \[Uses ‘more’ to compare Tom’s and Bob’s speaking speed\]

#### Superlative

Tom speaks more quickly than Bob, but Harry speaks the most quickly of them all. \[Uses ‘most’ to compare Harry’s speaking speed to that of the others\]

Not all adverbs follow this regular pattern of using ‘more’ or ‘most’ to show comparison. The following examples show irregular adverbs.

### Example

*   He spoke well, but she spoke better.
*   You finished work early, but they finished even earlier.

Adverbs don’t always show or imply comparison. These are called positive adverbs.

### Example

*   Tom spoke quickly. \[Tom’s speaking speed is not compared with anything else.\]
*   The staff worked happily. \[We don’t know if they worked more happily than others.\]
