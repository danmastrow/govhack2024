Adjectives
==========

Adjectives describe, compare and define nouns and words that act as nouns. Use adjectives to help people understand meaning.  

Adjectives describe nouns
-------------------------

Adjectives describe [nouns](/node/122), [noun phrases](/node/144#noun_phrases_function_as_a_noun) and [noun clauses](/node/143).

Adjectives usually go immediately before the noun. They can go elsewhere in a sentence – for example, as [a predicate](/node/120).

### Example

*   They had a short conversation. \[The adjective ‘short’ describes the noun ‘conversation’.\]
*   Their conversation was short. \[The adjective ‘short’ describes the noun ‘conversation’, but appears as the predicate in this sentence.\]

Adjectives also modify noun phrases and noun clauses.

### Example

*   They had a short conversation about the meeting. \[A noun phrase\]
*   They had a short conversation that led to a decision. \[A noun clause\]

Different types of words, such as nouns, can also function as adjectives.

### Example

*   A moving speech brought the sound of applause. \[A verbal noun (gerund) functioning as an adjective\]

Adjectives can affect clarity
-----------------------------

Use adjectives sparingly and only when they are essential for meaning. Remove any adjective that doesn’t play a critical function in a [sentence](https://dtg.govcms.gov.au/node/204).

Because adjectives are modifiers, they can affect clarity. A lack of clarity can cause users to lose trust in government content.

Compound adjectives can have hyphens
------------------------------------

Adjectives can be joined with [hyphens to make compound adjectives](/node/105#use_hyphens_for_some_compound_words). A compound adjective usually has a hyphen if the adjective is before the noun it is describing.

### Example

*   We need a fit-for-purpose strategy to solve this specific problem. \[Adjective before the noun ‘strategy’\]
*   The strategy is fit for purpose. \[Adjective after the noun ‘strategy’\]

A compound adjective can be made up of an [adverb](/node/127) and a [verb](https://dtg.govcms.gov.au/verbs).

A common error with adverbs and hyphens is when people insert a hyphen into this kind of compound adjective. Don’t use hyphens with most adverbs finishing in ‘-ly’.

### Correct

*   A badly worded sentence can be difficult to read, even if it is grammatically correct.

### Incorrect

*   A badly-worded sentence can be difficult to read, even if it is grammatically-correct.

There are few exceptions to this rule, so check a dictionary if you are unsure.

Most adjectives use different degrees for comparisons
-----------------------------------------------------

Degree shows the relative scale of the words being described, such as speed, size or quality. Most adjectives can have ‘degree’.

These adjectives usually follow the pattern of adding ‘-er’ or ‘-est’ to the end to show the degree.

### Example

#### Positive

Claire is a fast talker. \[There is no comparison. Claire is fast.\]

#### Comparative

Sam is a faster talker than Claire. \[Adds ‘-er’ to compare Claire’s and Sam’s talking speed.\]

#### Superlative

Sam is faster than Claire, but Petra is the fastest of them all. \[Adds ‘-est’ to compare Petra’s talking speed to that of the others.\]

Not all adjectives follow the regular pattern of ‘fast–faster–fastest’. These irregular adjectives have different patterns.

### Example

*   little, less, least
*   good, better, best
*   bad, worse, worst

Some adjectives don’t have a different form to show degree. They show degree by using ‘more’ for comparative or ‘most’ for superlative.

### Example

*   The department decided on a more flexible approach to working arrangements.
*   This is the most significant reform of public health policy in decades.

Some adjectives don’t have degree because you can’t compare them. For example, nothing can be more unique than something else.

There is a common order for strings of adjectives
-------------------------------------------------

Write strings of adjectives in an order that creates a more natural-sounding English. This order is determined by the types of adjectives used. List adjectives in this order:

1.  evaluative – features of a noun that you can measure or compare 
2.  descriptive – features of a noun that you can’t measure
3.  definitive – features of a noun that are intrinsic to the noun.

Evaluative adjectives can also express an opinion.

### Example

*   A beautiful round committee table

In this example:

*   ‘beautiful’ is evaluative because it expresses an opinion
*   ‘round’ is descriptive because it’s a feature you can observe but can’t measure
*   ‘committee’ is definitive because it is intrinsic to the noun ‘table’.

Strings of adjectives have:

*   commas between adjectives of the same type
*   no commas between adjectives of different types
*   no commas and no ‘and’ before definitive adjectives.

### Example

*   A large, black nuclear submarine \[‘Large’ and ‘black’ are descriptive; ‘nuclear’ is definitive.\]
*   A new, red long-range electric car \[‘New’ and ‘red’ are descriptive; ‘long-range’ and ‘electric’ are definitive.\]

You can also use ‘and’ instead of [commas to help the sentence flow more smoothly](/node/109).

### Example

*   A new and shiny red long-range electric car

The meaning of nouns and adjectives shouldn’t overlap
-----------------------------------------------------

Don’t use an adjective if it repeats a quality or property that is part of the noun.

### Example

*   absolute perfection \[Perfection is always absolute.\]
*   added bonus \[All bonuses are added.\]
*   emergency situation \[An emergency is always a situation.\]
*   future prospect \[Prospects are always in the future.\]

The digital edition gives an overview of adjectives based on the information from the sixth edition. It links to other pages that have detailed information on specific aspects of adjectives.

The sixth edition had information about adjectives in many different sections of the manual.

The Content Guide had only a brief mention of adjectives.

Adverbs
=======

Adverbs modify meaning when they’re added to a sentence. Use them occasionally to show people how, when, where, or the extent to which something happens.  

Adverbs add more information about other types of words
-------------------------------------------------------

Adverbs modify verbs, adjectives and other adverbs. They often, but not always, end in ‘-ly’.

### Example

*   The staff worked happily. \[Modifies the verb ‘worked’\]
*   The staff arrived early this morning. \[Modifies the verb ‘arrived’\]
*   She is a very dedicated worker. \[Modifies the adjective ‘dedicated’\]
*   You finished quite quickly. \[Modifies the adverb ‘quickly’\]

Adverbs can affect clarity
--------------------------

Use adverbs sparingly. Remove any adverb that doesn’t play a critical function in a [sentence](/node/204).

Because adverbs are modifiers, they can affect clarity. A lack of clarity can cause users to lose trust in government content.

Comparison with adverbs is by degree
------------------------------------

Like adjectives, adverbs can have degree to show or imply a comparison. In general, you simply add the word ‘more’ or ‘most’ in front of the adverb.

Depending on the context, some [words can be adjectives or adverbs](/node/203). Make sure you use the correct form. For example, ‘quickest’ is the adjective and ‘most quickly’ is the adverb.

### Example

#### Comparative

Bob spoke more quickly than Tom. \[Uses ‘more’ to compare Tom’s and Bob’s speaking speed\]

#### Superlative

Tom speaks more quickly than Bob, but Harry speaks the most quickly of them all. \[Uses ‘most’ to compare Harry’s speaking speed to that of the others\]

Not all adverbs follow this regular pattern of using ‘more’ or ‘most’ to show comparison. The following examples show irregular adverbs.

### Example

*   He spoke well, but she spoke better.
*   You finished work early, but they finished even earlier.

Adverbs don’t always show or imply comparison. These are called positive adverbs.

### Example

*   Tom spoke quickly. \[Tom’s speaking speed is not compared with anything else.\]
*   The staff worked happily. \[We don’t know if they worked more happily than others.\]

The sixth edition has substantial information about adverbs in different sections.

The Content Guide mentions adverbs in the advice on hyphens. It does not provide any other information about adverbs.

Conjunctions
============

Conjunctions join whole sentences or parts of a sentence together. They can show people how ideas are linked, or how ideas contrast.  

Conjunctions join words, phrases and clauses
--------------------------------------------

Use conjunctions to connect words, [phrases](/node/144) and [clauses](/node/143).

Examples of conjunctions are:

*   and
*   but
*   or
*   because
*   when.

### Example

*   The team met early because the manager requested it.
*   Print the page in black and white, please.
*   Lee wanted casual or part-time work.
*   Give me a call when you have finished the report.

Some conjunctions are paired
----------------------------

Some conjunctions come in pairs, such as ‘whether/or’, ‘either/or’ and ‘neither/nor’. Each conjunction in the pair should appear before the same type of word, phrase or clause.

### Example

*   Whether rain or shine, we’re going ahead with the team-building exercise. \[Both conjunctions pair with a noun.\]
*   My manager and I discussed both my performance review and my career prospects. \[Both conjunctions pair with a noun phrase.\]
*   Either we complete the report today, or we work on it tomorrow. \[Both conjunctions pair with clauses.\]

Coordinating conjunctions join things of equal importance
---------------------------------------------------------

Coordinating conjunctions include ‘and’, ‘but’ and ‘or’. They link words, phrases and clauses that are of the same importance.

### Example

*   The Australian Defence Force will build new patrol boats and submarines. \[Joining nouns\]
*   Work quickly but carefully. \[Joining adverbs\]
*   The answer is true or false. \[Joining adjectives\]
*   The content designers had Post-its on the wall and on the floor. \[Joining phrases\]
*   Schools reopened so students returned. \[Joining clauses\]

Coordinating conjunctions can also join clauses that could stand alone as sentences.

### Example

Keep the sentence simple otherwise the message will get lost.

Subordinating conjunctions join clauses and phrases to a main clause
--------------------------------------------------------------------

Subordinating conjunctions join the main clause to a subordinate (or ‘dependent’) clause or phrase.

The main clause can stand alone as a sentence. Dependent clauses add to the main clause: they depend on it to [form a complete sentence](/node/120).

Examples of subordinating conjunctions are:

*   when
*   if
*   unless
*   until
*   because
*   since.

### Example

*   When you get to work, please phone your new client. \[‘Please phone your new client’ is the main clause; ‘when you get to work’ is the dependent clause.\]
*   Take care of your health as though your life depends on it. \[‘Take care of your health’ is the main clause; ‘your life depends on it’ is the dependent clause.\]

Some adverbs work as conjunctions
---------------------------------

A conjunctive adverb is a word that does 2 things at the same time.

*   It joins 2 main clauses.
*   It modifies a verb, an adjective, another adverb or a whole clause.

They are weaker connections than coordinating or subordinating conjunctions.

### Example

A quick guide outlines the issue, besides detailing other sources on the topic.

Conjunctive adverbs are often not needed. They add nuance to writing, but use them sparingly. You can usually delete them and keep meaning clear.

### Example

*   The deadline was still weeks away; however, it was going to be tough to meet. \[The adverb ‘however’ links 2 main clauses.\]
*   The deadline was still weeks away. It was going to be tough to meet. \[No adverb links the 2 main clauses.\]

‘With’ is not a conjunction
---------------------------

Don’t use ‘with’ to add a clause at the beginning or end of a sentence. Reword or split the sentence to prevent this misuse. This helps create shorter, simpler sentences that are easier to read.

### Correct

The lake has had several blue-green algae outbreaks this year. It has been closed to swimming at least once a year since 2002.

### Incorrect

The lake has had several blue-green algae outbreaks this year, with the lake closed to swimming at least once a year since 2002.

The Content Guide did not have any information about conjunctions.

Determiners
===========

Determiners always go with a noun. They tell people something specific or general about the noun.  

Determiners are ‘articles’ that go with nouns
---------------------------------------------

Determiners introduce a [noun](/node/122) or a [noun phrase](/node/144). Determiners give more information about the noun they are introducing. They are also called ‘articles’.

They show users:

*   which things you are referring to
*   whether you are referring to specific or to generic things and ideas
*   how many things there are.

Determiners include:

*   articles such as ‘a’, ‘an’ or ‘the’
*   pronouns such as ‘those’, ‘my’ or ‘some’
*   numbers such as ‘2’, ‘14’ or ‘23 million’.

Definite articles refer to a specific thing or things
-----------------------------------------------------

The word ‘the’ is the ‘definite article’. It defines which specific thing you are referring to.

### Example

They finished the report on time and on budget. \[This sentence refers to a specific report.\]

You can use ‘the’ for a group of things, but only if you refer to a specific group.

### Example

The employees were on time for the meeting. \[Specific employees were on time.\]

Don’t use ‘the’ when you make a generalisation.

### Example

People work in offices. \[This is a generalisation about people and offices.\]

Indefinite articles let you make generalisations
------------------------------------------------

The words ‘a’ and ‘an’ are ‘indefinite articles’. Use them when you are referring to a generic thing or idea rather than a specific one.

### Example

*   A school should teach a child how to read and write. \[This could be any school and any child.\]
*   An EL2 usually supervises several staff. \[This could be any EL2.\]

Choose ‘a’ or ‘an’ according to the sound of the word after it:

*   Use ‘a’ if the following word starts with a consonant sound.
*   Use ‘an’ if the following word starts with a vowel sound.

The same rule applies to shortened words and phrases ([abbreviations](/node/184), [acronyms and initialisms](/node/190), and [contractions](/node/191)).

Some vowels have a hidden ‘y’ consonant sound at the beginning. For example, you would read ‘universal’ as ‘yew-nee-ver-sahl’.

Say the noun out loud. If it starts with the hidden ‘y’ sound, use ‘a’.

### Example

*   It was an error. \[The ‘e’ sound in ‘error’ is a vowel.\]
*   It was a cold office. \[The ‘c’ sound in ‘cold’ is a consonant.\]
*   The job required a university degree. \[The ‘u’ sound in ‘university’ sounds like the consonant ‘y’.\]

For words that start with ‘h’:

*   Use ‘an’ only before words that start with a silent ‘h’, such as ‘honour’ or ‘hour’.
*   Use ‘a’ for all other words starting with ‘h’, such as ‘historian’ or 'hotel’, when the ‘h’ is spoken.

Pronouns can function as determiners
------------------------------------

Some pronouns introduce nouns, so they work as determiners. Examples of these pronouns are ‘any’, ‘some’, ‘this’, ‘that’, ‘these’, ‘those’, ‘my’, ‘your’, ‘his’, ‘her’.

Pronouns, working as determiners, can show which noun you are referring to.

### Example

*   Write some instructions.
*   Those meetings were long but fruitful.
*   Give it your best shot.

Pronouns can also quantify the noun.

### Example

*   Every public servant knows the code of conduct.
*   Most reports are well written.
*   Few people have time to fill out forms.

Numbers can function as determiners
-----------------------------------

Numbers work as determiners because they give information about how many nouns they are introducing.

### Example

*   They had 2 meetings.
*   This is my second cup of coffee for the day.
*   This month, the minister delivered 3 keynote addresses.

The digital edition relates grammatical concepts to the principles of plain language. It relates word choice to grammatical information about [types of words](https://dtg.govcms.gov.au/node/203).

It provides an overview on types of words to introduce grammatical concepts about parts of speech and how they relate to sentence structure.

The sixth edition called types of words ‘word classes’. It had summary information about parts of speech on pages 68 to 70. This formed part of Chapter 5 on grammar.

The Content Guide did not have any in-depth information on grammatical concepts.

Nouns
=====

Nouns are the words that name people, places, organisations and things. Style and grammar support how people interpret nouns in content.  

Proper nouns are the names of people and specific things
--------------------------------------------------------

Any name for a specific person, organisation, place or thing is a ‘proper noun’.

Proper nouns always start with capital letters, except for [some commercial terms](/node/89).

### Example

*   June
*   Shark Bay
*   Collingwood Football Club
*   Torres Strait Regional Authority
*   Prime Minister of Australia

There are specific capitalisation conventions for the:

*   [titles of office holders](/node/149)
*   [names of organisations](/node/88)
*   [government terms](/node/136).

Common nouns are words for generic things
-----------------------------------------

Common nouns describe people, places, times or things in a general sense. They have a capital letter only when they are the first word in a sentence.

### Example

*   month
*   coast
*   local government
*   prime ministers

Capitalise nouns only if they are part of a proper noun. Don’t capitalise them if you use them as common nouns.

### Example

*   The ACT’s Office of the Commissioner for the Environment was the first such agency in Australia. \[‘Office’ is part of the formal title.\]
*   I worked in the office for 11 years. \[‘Office’ is not part of the formal title, even if it refers to the Office of the Commissioner for the Environment.\]

Common nouns can be concrete or abstract
----------------------------------------

Concrete nouns name things you can identify through one or more of the 5 senses.

### Example

*   server
*   phone
*   software
*   person

Abstract nouns name intangible things. These include ideas, emotions and physical feelings.

### Example

*   honesty
*   reliance
*   engagement
*   admiration

Some nouns can be either concrete or abstract, depending on the context.

### Example

*   The office is upstairs. \[Concrete noun\]
*   Alfred Deakin was the first to hold the office of Attorney-General in Australia. \[Abstract noun\]

Verbal nouns are also called ‘gerunds’
--------------------------------------

Gerunds are nouns that form by attaching an ‘-ing’ to a verb.

### Example

*   meet \[verb\], meeting \[noun\]
*   report \[verb\], reporting \[noun\]

You can combine gerunds and other verbal nouns with a [determiner](/node/132#pronouns_can_function_as_determiners) (such as ‘my’ or ‘your’).

### Example

*   Your writing has improved. \[‘Your’ is the determiner; ‘writing’ is the noun; ‘has improved’ is the verb.\]
*   They resent Bill’s laughing at them. \[‘Bill’s’ is the determiner; ‘resent’ is the verb; ‘laughing’ is the noun.\]

Verbal nouns also include nouns that relate to verbs in another way. For example, the noun can form by adding other types of suffix to a verb like ‘-ation’ or ‘-ment’. These are not gerunds.

### Example

*   fixation \[Noun related to the verb ‘fix’\]
*   attachment \[Noun related to the verb ‘attach’\]

Other verbal nouns don’t have any suffix but have the same spelling as the verb. It is context that gives the distinction.

### Example

*   ‘fix the issue’ \[verb\], ‘a quick fix’ \[noun\]
*   ‘report an issue’ \[verb\], ‘annual report to the minister’ \[noun\]

Nouns can be singular or plural
-------------------------------

Nouns can be singular or plural. Most English words add an ‘-s’ or ‘-es’ to form the plural, but there are many exceptions. Check a dictionary if you’re not sure.

### Example

*   a computer, many computers
*   a policy, many policies
*   the standby, many standbys
*   the Attorney-General, many attorneys-general

Some nouns don’t change to form the plural.

### Example

an aircraft, many aircraft

Don’t use an apostrophe before (or after) the ‘s’ to show the plural.

### Correct

Adjust the desks and chairs.

### Incorrect

Adjust the desk’s and chair’s.

Collective nouns describe a group in a single word
--------------------------------------------------

Collective nouns are a type of common noun. They label groups of people or things.

### Example

*   crowd
*   committee
*   cluster \[for example, of desks\]

### Subject–verb agreement

A collective noun usually has a [singular verb](/node/128). This is so, even if it’s made up of component parts.

#### Correct

*   The government intends to act.
*   The committee is meeting.

#### Incorrect

*   The government intend to act.
*   The committee are meeting.

An exception is when you need to draw attention to the individual parts of the collective noun.

#### Example

*   The branch meets once a week. \[‘The branch’, as a whole, meets once a week. The singular form of the verb is used.\]
*   The branch are divided over the new meeting schedule. \[The individuals in ‘the branch’ have different opinions about the new meeting schedule. The plural form of the verb is used.\]

Nouns can be countable or uncountable
-------------------------------------

You can sort nouns by whether they can be separated into individual units and counted:

*   You can count countable nouns.
*   You cannot count uncountable nouns.

### Example

Would you like a cup of coffee or tea? \[‘Cup’ is countable; ‘coffee’ and ‘tea’ are uncountable.\]

A countable singular noun must have a determiner.

### Correct

*   The report is being printed.
*   Our report is being printed.

### Incorrect

Report is being printed.

An uncountable noun has no plural and only a singular verb. Uncountable nouns don’t need to have a determiner. Whether it has one depends on the meaning of the sentence.

### Example

*   Respect is an Australian Public Service value. \[No determiner with ‘respect’. The value is not quantifiable.\]
*   The leadership avoided a spill. \[‘The’ is the determiner with ‘leadership’. The noun refers to a single, specific group of people.\]

Some nouns can be used both ways. The meaning depends on whether the noun is countable or uncountable in the way it is used:

*   In the uncountable form, it refers to the whole idea or quantity.
*   In the countable form, it refers to a specific example or type.

### Example

*   Language is powerful. \[In this context, ‘language’ is uncountable.\]
*   Australians speak many languages besides English. \[In this context, ‘language’ is countable.\]

Noun trains are hard to understand
----------------------------------

Strings of 3 or more nouns are known as ‘noun trains’. Each noun in a noun train modifies the next.

Rewrite a sentence to avoid using a noun train. This will help you [write in plain language](/node/55).

### Write this

The agency’s new system will help to improve how it manages injuries. \[No noun train\]

### Not this

The agency’s new system will help in the achievement of injury management outcome improvements. \[Noun train included\]

Prepositions
============

A preposition creates relationships between words or phrases. Some words only work with specific prepositions. Choose them deliberately to convey meaning to users.  
  

A preposition creates relationships between words or phrases
------------------------------------------------------------

Prepositions show a relationship between a [noun](/node/122) or [v](https://dtg.govcms.gov.au/format-writing-and-structure/clear-language-and-expression/words-and-function/pronouns)[erb](/node/128). Use prepositions to give information about the time and place of an action or thing.

Examples of prepositions are:

*   in
*   before
*   around
*   since
*   between.

Prepositions often come before related words or [phrases](/node/144).

### Example

*   Put the book on the table. \['On' shows the position of 'the book' in relation to 'the table'.\]
*   During her time in office, she launched 50 projects. \['During' refers to 'her time'; 'in' refers to 'office'.\]
*   They had many discussions about the restructure. \['About' refers to 'the restructure'.\]

You can use some prepositions as a different type of word, depending on their function in the sentence. For example, 'down' can be a preposition, part of a verb or an adverb.

### Example

*   I walked down the hill. \['Down' is a preposition.\]
*   Prices came down from an all-time high. \['Down' is part of the phrasal verb 'came down'. 'From' is the preposition.\]
*   Please read down to the bottom of the page. \['Down' is an adverb describing the verb 'read'.\]

Some words only work with specific prepositions
-----------------------------------------------

Not all prepositions work for every word or phrase. Some words are always followed by particular prepositions. For example, 'different' is always followed by 'to' or 'from', but not by 'than'. Check a dictionary if you are not sure.

### Correct

*   This is different from that.
*   The discussion about the program is continuing.

### Incorrect

*   This is different than that.
*   The discussion around the program is continuing.

The Content Guide did not have any in-depth information on grammatical concepts.

Pronouns
========

Pronouns replace other words. People will find content easier to read when pronouns match their context.  

Pronouns stand in for other words
---------------------------------

Pronouns stand in for [nouns](/node/122). They stand in for groups of words that function as nouns ([noun phrases](/node/144) and [noun clauses](/node/143#subordinate_clauses_depend_on_the_main_clause)). They can also act like [determiners](/node/132).

### Example

*   I, he, she, they, it
*   myself, yourself, ourselves
*   who, which, that
*   any, several

Pronouns can be singular or plural.

### Example

*   I, we
*   she, they
*   me, us

Types of pronouns function as different types of words
------------------------------------------------------

There are 6 main types of pronouns:

*   Personal pronouns replace the names of people or things. They include ‘I’, ‘me’, ‘we’, ‘us’, ‘it’, ‘they’, ‘them’, ‘she’, ‘her’, ‘he’ and ‘him’.
*   Reflexive pronouns reflect the action of the verb back to the subject. They include ‘myself’, ‘ourselves’, ‘itself’, ‘themself’, ‘themselves’, ‘herself’ and ‘himself’.
*   Relative pronouns refer to nouns that are already known from the context. They include ‘who’, ‘whom’, ‘whose’, ‘which’ and ‘that’.
*   Interrogative pronouns ask questions. They include ‘what’, ‘which’, ‘who’, ‘whom’ and ‘whose’.
*   Demonstrative pronouns specify which noun you are referring to. They include ‘this’, ‘that’, ‘these’ and ‘those’.
*   Indefinite pronouns don’t specify quantity or number. They include ‘any’, ‘each’, ‘several’ and ‘some’.

Some pronouns can work as other types of words. For example, ‘my’, ‘his’, ‘hers’, ‘our’, ‘their’ and ‘your’ work as determiners.

### Example

*   I gave her the report. She gave me a card. \[Personal pronouns\]
*   I told myself I could finish on time. \[Reflexive pronoun\]
*   The person who wrote the report has left. \[Relative pronoun\]
*   Who left the lights on in the office? \[Interrogative pronoun\]
*   This is mine. That one is yours. \[Demonstrative pronouns\]
*   Do you have any feedback? Yes, I have some. \[Indefinite pronouns\]

Singular pronouns have a gender-neutral form. Use the forms:

*   ‘they’ instead of ‘he’ or ‘she’
*   ‘them’ instead of ‘him’ or ‘her’
*   ‘their’ instead of ‘his’ or ‘hers’.

Pronouns take different forms depending on their function
---------------------------------------------------------

The form of a pronoun will change depending on whether it is the subject or the object of the verb. This is the ‘case’ of the pronoun.

A pronoun used as the subject in a sentence is in the subjective case (for example, ‘I’, ‘they’).

A pronoun used as the object in a sentence is in the objective case (for example, ‘me’, ‘them’).

### Example

*   I emailed them. \[‘I’ is the subject and ‘them’ is the object.\]
*   They emailed me. \[‘They’ is the subject and ‘me’ is the object.\]

When the singular ‘they’ is used in a sentence as a [gender-neutral](/node/64#use_genderneutral_language) term, it takes the plural form of a verb.

Use the correct case when writing pronouns. Check whether the pronoun should be in the subjective or the objective case – whether it is the [subject or object](/node/120#a_full_sentence_is_grammatically_complete).

### Correct

*   My colleague and I travelled with the delegation.
*   My manager sent their director and me an email.

### Incorrect

*   My colleague and me travelled with the delegation.
*   My manager sent their director and I an email.

Sentences can have reflexive pronouns when the subject is also the object of the verb.

### Example

The manager emailed themself. \[‘Themself’ is the object but refers to ‘the manager’, which is the subject.\]

Don’t use a reflexive pronoun if the subject and the object are not the same person or thing.

### Correct

I emailed myself.

### Incorrect

The manager emailed myself.

Don’t use reflexive pronouns such as ‘yourself’ and ‘myself’ as the subject of the verb.

### Correct

My colleague and I travelled with the delegation.

### Incorrect

My colleague and myself travelled with the delegation.

Relative pronouns show essential or non-essential information
-------------------------------------------------------------

To make your writing clear, use:

*   ‘that’ for essential information
*   ‘which’, with punctuation, for non-essential information.

It is important to show users whether information is essential or non-essential by using punctuation, for example [commas](/node/109#mark_out_nonessential_information_within_a_sentence).

### Example

*   The farm that produces oats is for sale. \[The only farm that is for sale is the one that produces oats.\]
*   The farm, which produces oats, is for sale. \[The farm, which happens to produce oats, is for sale.\]

Choosing between relative pronouns can be a matter of style in some situations, depending on [voice and tone](/node/40). It is the use of punctuation with the relative pronoun that clarifies meaning.

The digital edition relates grammatical concepts to the principles of plain language. It relates word choice to grammatical information about [types of words](https://dtg.govcms.gov.au/node/203).

It provides an overview on types of words to introduce grammatical concepts about parts of speech and how they relate to sentence structure.

The sixth edition called types of words ‘word classes’. It had summary information about parts of speech on pages 68 to 70. This formed part of Chapter 5 on grammar.

The digital edition consolidates information about pronouns. It gives an overview of the types of pronouns and highlights common cases of incorrect use. Some of the information covered in the sixth edition – for example, gender-neutral pronouns – is relevant to [inclusive language for gender and sexual diversity](/node/64).

The Content Guide did not have any in-depth information on grammatical concepts. It recommended avoiding use of gender-specific pronouns, consistent with advice in this edition of the Style Manual to use gender-neutral language. It also had some information on [using pronouns for tone](/node/40).

Types of words
==============

Keep the functions of words in mind to write clear content. Grammar and sentence structure help people understand meaning.

Words are grouped by function
-----------------------------

Each word has a function in a [sentence](/node/120), [clause](/node/143) or [phrase](/node/144). You can group words into different types depending on the way they function.

Functions include:

*   [adjectives](/node/126)
*   [adverbs](/node/127)
*   [conjunctions](/node/129)
*   [determiners](/node/132)
*   [nouns](/node/122)
*   [prepositions](/node/130)
*   [pronouns](/node/131)
*   [verbs](/node/128).

Functional categories for words are also known as ‘parts of speech’.

Sentence structure sets the function of words
---------------------------------------------

Many individual words can belong to different word types. This depends on what the word is doing in the sentence.

The function of the word depends on the role it plays in combination with others.

### Example

*   You can face penalties for using a still to make alcohol without the proper licence. \[‘Still’ is a noun.\]
*   The dinghy was floating in still water. \[‘Still’ is an adjective.\]
*   The people stood still during the national anthem. \[‘Still’ is an adverb.\]

You can change the meaning of a sentence by moving a word.

Place modifying words, such as adjectives and adverbs, next to the thing that they’re modifying. The same applies to adverbial and adjectival phrases and clauses.

If you don’t put the modifier in the right place, people will find it difficult to understand your content.

The following sentences are all grammatically correct. The meaning changes as the modifier ‘only’ is moved.

### Example

Only Jamilah told Freddie that she respected him. \[No one else told Freddie.\]

Jamilah only told Freddie that she respected him. \[Jamilah didn’t write to Freddie. She just told him.\]

Jamilah told only Freddie that she respected him. \[Jamilah didn’t tell anyone else she respected him. She also didn’t tell anyone else that she respected them.\]

Jamilah told Freddie only that she respected him. \[Jamilah didn’t tell Freddie anything else.\]

Jamilah told Freddie that only she respected him. \[No one else respects Freddie.\]

Jamilah told Freddie that she only respected him. \[Jamilah doesn’t have any other opinion of Freddie.\]

Jamilah told Freddie that she respected only him. \[Jamilah doesn’t respect anyone else.\]

Fixing a misplaced modifier is more complicated. Sentences with this issue often need some rewriting.

### Write this

The report suggested that the drug is beneficial, even though it’s harmful in larger doses. \[‘It’ in the modifier refers to ‘the drug’.\]

### Not this

Even though it’s harmful in larger doses, the report suggested the drug is beneficial. \[‘It’ in the modifier could go with ‘the report’ or ‘the drug’. This structure weakens the modifier’s link with ‘the drug’. It creates ambiguity in meaning.\]

Verbs
=====

Verbs express when something happened, or that something is continuing or finished. Verbs help people make sense of other parts of a sentence or clause.  

Verbs describe an action, a state, an event or a change
-------------------------------------------------------

Verbs are words that describe:

*   an action
*   a state
*   an event
*   a change.

### Example

*   to work, to discuss, to try \[actions\]
*   to be, to have, to seem \[states\]
*   to happen, to occur, to result in \[events\]
*   to become, to grow, to dissolve \[changes\]

The form of the verb changes depending on the grammatical subject and tense.

Verbs must ‘agree’ with the subject
-----------------------------------

The form of the verb changes to show whether the subject is singular or plural (the number). This is called ‘subject–verb agreement’.

### Correct

The analyst works in the office on Mondays. \[There is one specific analyst, so the verb takes the singular form ‘works’.\]

### Incorrect

Jan work in the office on Mondays. \[There is one person, Jan, so the verb should not take the plural form ‘work’.\]

To decide which form of the verb you need, find its subject and ask ‘who’ or ‘what’ is doing the verb. Using the first example:

*   Question: Who works in the office on Mondays?
*   Answer: The analyst.

This answer might seem obvious, but subject–verb agreement is not always intuitive. For example, a common mistake is to use the plural form of a verb with a [collective noun](/node/122#collective_nouns_describe_a_group_in_a_single_word).

Sentences contain at least [a subject and a verb](/node/120#a_full_sentence_is_grammatically_complete). Keep the relationship between the grammatical subject and the verb clear to users. This relationship is the basis for writing [plain language sentences](/node/204#write_plain_language_sentences).

Objects complement some verbs
-----------------------------

Some verbs need an object to have meaning. For example, you don’t just need or take – you need ‘something’ or take ‘something’. These are ‘transitive’ verbs.

### Example

*   They need advice before the hearing. \[‘Advice’ is the object of the verb ‘need’.\]
*   Take my advice. \[‘My advice’ is the object of the verb ‘take’.\]

Some verbs don’t have an object. These are ‘intransitive’ verbs. Intransitive verbs can instead have a complement in the form of an [adverb](/node/127) or [adverbial phrase](/node/144).

### Example

*   The power grid failed. \[The verb ‘failed’ does not have an object.\]
*   The candidate campaigned tirelessly. \[The verb ‘campaigned’ does not have an object. ‘Tirelessly’ is an adverb. The adverb complements the verb.\]

Some verbs can be transitive or intransitive. They can have meaning with or without an object, depending on the rest of the sentence.

### Example

*   They opened the door. \[The object is ‘the door’.\]
*   The door opened. \[‘Opened’ has no object.\]

A complement can go with a verb that links the subject to an attribute, quality or characteristic. This type of complement is not an object, but completes the sentence. They are often [adjectival phrases](/node/144#adjectival_phrases_function_as_adjectives) or [adjectives](/node/126).

### Example

*   The door is open. \[‘Open’ complements the verb ‘is’. It is an adjective that describes the subject, ‘the door’.\]
*   The forecasts seem reasonable. \[‘Reasonable’ complements the verb ‘seem’. It is an adjective describes the subject, ‘the forecasts’.\]
*   Each agency has its own arrangements. \[‘Its own arrangements’ complements the verb ‘has’. The complement is a noun phrase describing an attribute of the subject, ‘each agency’.\]

Tense changes the form of the verb
----------------------------------

The form of the verb can also change to show:

*   when something happened (past, present or future) – this is the tense of the verb
*   whether something is continuing or has finished.

### Example

*   I was writing the report last week, but I couldn’t finish it. \[The action is in the past tense and is continuing. I didn’t finish writing the report last week.\]
*   I wrote the report yesterday. \[The action is in the past tense and has finished.\]
*   I am writing another report today. \[The action is in the present tense and it is continuing.\]
*   I will write a final report tomorrow. \[The action is in the future tense and it will be finished tomorrow.\]
*   By next week, the executive will have reviewed the report. \[The action is in the future tense and will be finished by next week.\]

Verbs like ‘will’ change the form of the main verb ‘to write’. Verbs added to the main verb are ‘auxiliary’ verbs.

The ‘mood’ of a verb conveys meaning
------------------------------------

You can use verbs to describe a fact, express a wish, or make a command or request. The term for this use is ‘mood’.

### Indicative mood

This mood expresses simple statements or questions.

#### Example

*   Jan went into the office on Monday.
*   The commander ordered the troops to stand at ease.
*   Was the report tabled in July this year?

### Imperative mood

This is the mood for expressing urgency, commands, pleas and requests.

The imperative mood is direct. It works well for instructions and where there is limited space, such as in [forms](/node/177).

#### Example

*   Apply now.
*   Lodge your submission by 31 July.
*   Verify your corporate credit card.

Be deliberate about the tone the content needs to convey. Imperative commands can seem blunt, even if you use the word ‘please’.

#### Example

Please speak up.

### Subjunctive mood

This is the mood for expressing possibility. It shows that something is hypothetical, possible, conceivable or desirable.

#### Example

*   If supply were to stop, we wouldn’t be able to meet demand.
*   If only they would update the data!
*   You should apply now.

Verbs in the subjunctive mood can work together with other words to express a condition.

#### Example

*   If you took a sample, you would have some data.
*   If you applied now, we could process your application tomorrow.

The subjunctive mood doesn’t always need an auxiliary verb to show the mood, only the main verb. Recommendations can follow this formula.

#### Example

Recommendations

*   That the Minister meet with peak body representatives.

You can use auxiliary verbs to convey ability, possibility, permission or obligation. This affects the [tone of your writing](/node/40).

These verbs are:

*   can
*   could
*   may
*   might
*   will
*   would
*   shall
*   should
*   must
*   ought to.

#### Example

*   This could take some time.
*   You must submit your application by close of business.

Phrasal verbs need a preposition or adverb
------------------------------------------

Phrasal verbs are verbs paired with one or more [prepositions](/node/130). They can also go with an [adverb](/node/127). Check the dictionary entry for the verb to use the correct combination.

### Example

*   We need to check in with each other. \[The verb ‘check’ pairs with the prepositions ‘in’ and ‘with’.\]
*   They found out 6 breaches had occurred. \[The verb ‘found’ goes with the adverb ‘out’.\]

When phrasal verbs need an object, you can put the object between the verb and its other part.

### Example

The clue gave away the answer. \[The object, ‘the answer’, comes after both parts of the phrasal verb, ‘gave away’.\]  
The clue gave the answer away. \[The object comes between the first and second part of the phrasal verb.\]
